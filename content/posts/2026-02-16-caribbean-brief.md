## 🎭 Trinidad: J'ouvert Done, Parade of the Bands Tomorrow

Carnival Monday is winding down in Trinidad after a J'ouvert that started before dawn and a full day of revelry through Port of Spain, Tunapuna, and beyond. Police confiscated an impressive collection of weapons during early morning exercises — because some people apparently think Carnival is a medieval tournament.

Tomorrow is the big one: Parade of the Bands on Carnival Tuesday. The country will be functionally closed. Don't call anyone in Trinidad tomorrow unless it's an emergency.

Meanwhile, opposition leader Ralph Thorne couldn't even vote on election day because his name was missing from the register. When you can't participate in the democracy you're trying to lead, that's a special kind of bad day.
