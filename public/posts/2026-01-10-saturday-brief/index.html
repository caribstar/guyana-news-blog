According to their lawyer, Sanjeev Datadin, the US wants to extradite them because they’re “Indian Guyanese” and “successful businessmen.”\nLet’s Break This Down:\nTheir Argument: America is targeting them because of their ethnicity and success.\nReality: America is targeting them because Florida has an active criminal case against them for money laundering.\nThe Victim Narrative: “We’ve done nothing wrong! We’re being persecuted!”\nThe Court Record: Multiple appeals, all denied. Multiple judges, all said “no.” The pattern is clear.\nD LEGAL STRATEGY TRACKER:\nStrategy #1: \"We didn't do it\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #2: \"The evidence is weak\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #3: \"The process is unfair\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #4: \"We're victims of discrimination\" â³ Current attempt\nKaieteur News (As Always): Has written enough about the Mohameds to fill a library. At this point, they could publish The Complete Mohamed Saga: Volumes 1-47.\nThe Timeline: Every time a court says no, they find a new reason to appeal. They’ve turned extradition into a marathon sport.\nâš¡ CONTRACTOR NEARLY KILLS HIMSELF (AND HALF OF GEORGETOWN) âš ï¸ CLOSE CALL ALERT âš ï¸\nPower Line Voltage: 69,000 volts\nCrane Proximity: Too close\nSafety Protocol Followed: Questionable\nOutcome: Everyone lived (somehow)\nA contractor working on Sheriff Street almost touched a 69,000-volt power line with his crane. Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.\nFor Context: That’s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No “oops, my bad.”\nWhat Happened:\nContractor lifting materials Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines GPL (Guyana Power \u0026 Light) technicians notice Emergency shutdown before catastrophe The Scary Part: This wasn’t discovered by the contractor. This wasn’t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.\nTranslation: Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren’t followed. And we only know about it because GPL’s people were alert.\nNSTRUCTION WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan â†’ Survey site â†’ Identify hazards â†’ Implement safety â†’ Execute\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) â†’ Start work â†’ Almost cause disaster â†’ Act surprised â†’ Blame someone else\nThe Questions Nobody’s Asking:\nWho approved this project without a proper safety plan? Why were the power lines not clearly marked? What happens to the contractor? The Answers: Probably nothing, probably nobody, and definitely “we’re looking into it.”\nSTATS: MURDER UP, ROAD DEATHS UP, VIBES DOWN RIME STATISTICS:\nMurders: UP 11% (134 total)\nRoad Deaths: UP 6% (140 total)\nGovernment Response: \"Crime is down!\"\nPublic: \"Please be serious.\" The police released 2025 crime statistics, and the numbers tell a story the government doesn’t want to hear.\nMurders: 134 (up from 121 in 2024) Road Deaths: 140 (up from 132 in 2024)\nGovernment’s Spin: “Overall crime is down! Look at the big picture!”\nThe Big Picture: More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That’s the picture.\nThe Breakdown:\nMurders: 11% increase Road deaths: 6% increase Combined: 274 lives lost What Actually Decreased: Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?\nSING CRIME:\nWhat Works: Community policing, better training, accountability, improved response times\nWhat We Got: \"Crime is down!\" (when it's actually up in the categories that matter most)\nM GUYANA: STILL STRUGGLING The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.\nIncident #1: French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.\nIncident #2: British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana “Third World.” Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.\nThe Pattern: When tourists show reality, we attack the tourists instead of fixing the reality.\n40,000 HOUSES PROMISE G MATH CHECK:\nPromise: 40,000 houses by 2028\nTime Remaining: ~3 years\nRequired Pace: 37 houses PER DAY\nCurrent Reality: Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.\nVice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government’s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.\nLet’s Do The Math:\n40,000 houses Ã· 3 years = 13,333 houses/year 13,333 houses Ã· 365 days = 36.5 houses PER DAY For Perspective: That’s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.\nCurrent Status: They’ve allocated land. Land allocation â‰ built houses.\nECTRICITY PROMISE (REMEMBER THAT?) Remember when they promised “no more blackouts” by end of 2024? It’s 2026. Still waiting.\nThe Pattern:\nMake bold promise Miss deadline Announce new timeline Repeat POSITION: STILL MISSING Where is the opposition? Seriously, where are they? The Mohamed case has Parliament frozen. No sessions, no debates, no oversight.\nDemocracy Requires: Active opposition holding government accountable\nWhat We Have: Silence\nGOOD NEWS: AISHALTON AIRSTRIP Finally, some genuinely good news! The Aishalton airstrip project is actually progressing well. On time, on budget, serving the community.\nProof: Infrastructure projects CAN work when properly managed.\nATURDAY RECAP E LEARNED:\nThe Mohameds are now victims (apparently) 69,000 volts is not a suggestion Murder is up, but \"crime is down\" Tourists with cameras remain public enemy #1 40,000 houses = 37/day (good luck) The electricity promise aged poorly The opposition is on permanent vacation Aishalton proves we CAN do things right Sunday: Rest. Monday: More chaos.\nSubscribe at guyanadailybrief.com to get this delivered by noon.\nTHE GUYANA BRIEF: Making Guyana’s news slightly more bearable, one satirical digest at a time.\n","wordCount":"945","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-01-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-10T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-10-saturday-brief/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Saturday's Guyana Brief: Weekend News Circus</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 10, 2026</span></div></header><div class=post-content><div style="text-align:center;padding:40px 30px;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#009E60 0%,#FCD116 50%,#CE1126 100%);border-radius:15px;margin-bottom:30px"><h1 style="color:#fff;font-size:36px;margin:0 0 15px;text-shadow:2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.3)">E GUYANA BRIEF 1><p style=color:#fff;font-size:18px;margin:0;font-weight:500>Your 5-Minute Weekend News Circus</p><p style="color:#fff;font-size:14px;margin:10px 0 0;opacity:.9">Saturday, January 10, 2026</p><p style="color:#fff;font-size:12px;margin:5px 0 0;opacity:.8;font-style:italic">Sponsored by: Contractors Who Can't See 69,000-Volt Lines</p></div><h2 id=d-quick-stats>D QUICK STATS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#d-quick-stats>#</a></h2><div style="background:#fcd116;padding:20px;border-radius:10px;border:3px solid #ce1126;margin:20px 0"><p style="margin:5px 0"><strong>Mohamed Self-Pity Level:</strong> M</p><p style="margin:5px 0"><strong>Vloggers Regretting Guyana Visit:</strong> 2/2</p><p style="margin:5px 0"><strong>National Grid Near-Death Experiences:</strong> r One</p><p style="margin:5px 0"><strong>Opposition Pulse Check:</strong> âš°ï¸ Flatline</p><p style="margin:5px 0"><strong>Government Promises Kept:</strong> ching Zero</p></div><hr><h2 id=hameds-play-the-victim-card>HAMEDS PLAY THE VICTIM CARD<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hameds-play-the-victim-card>#</a></h2><div style="background:#ffe5e5;border-left:5px solid #f44336;padding:15px;margin:20px 0;border-radius:5px"><strong>MOHAMED THEATER:</strong><br>Role: Innocent Victimsâ„¢<br>Script: "Why is America so mean?"<br>Audience: Not buying it</div><p>The Mohameds are back with another performance, and this time they&rsquo;re playing the victim.
