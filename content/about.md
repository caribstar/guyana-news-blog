# About The Daily Laugh 🇬🇾

## Who We Are (Or Pretend To Be)

Welcome to **The Daily Laugh** - Guyana's premier source of news commentary for people who've given up on being surprised by anything.

We're the blog that reads all four of Guyana's major newspapers every single day so you don't have to wonder which version of reality to believe. Spoiler alert: They're all right. And they're all wrong. Simultaneously. It's quantum journalism.

## What We Do

Every day, we:
1. Read **Stabroek News** (the intellectual one)
2. Read **Kaieteur News** (the one with ALL THE CAPS)
3. Read **Chronicle** (the government's BFF)
4. Read **Guyana Times** (the one that really wants you to know about beauty pageants)
5. Lose our minds slightly
6. Write jokes about it
7. Post it here
8. Wait for the angry comments

It's like being a news aggregator, except we add the one thing traditional journalism forgot: **humor**.

## Our Mission Statement

**Mission:** To make you laugh about Guyana news before you cry about it.

**Vision:** A Guyana where people read satirical blogs instead of fighting in Facebook comments.

**Core Values:**
- Truth (but make it funny)
- Fairness (we roast everyone equally)
- Accuracy (in our fact-checking, not our jokes)
- Chaos (it's more fun)

**Our Motto:** *"We read the nonsense so you don't have to."*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are you real journalists?**  
A: No. We're satirists. There's a difference. Journalists have ethics committees. We have a delete button.

**Q: Do you hate Guyana?**  
A: We LOVE Guyana. That's why we care enough to mock its problems. If we didn't care, we'd just watch Netflix instead.

**Q: Why don't you write about [insert topic]?**  
A: Did it make the newspapers today? No? Then send us the story and we'll consider it for tomorrow's roundup.

**Q: Which newspaper do you work for?**  
A: None. We're independent, which means we're poor but honest.

**Q: Which political party do you support?**  
A: The Satire Party. Our platform is "everyone is ridiculous." We're undefeated in elections we haven't contested.

**Q: Can I share your posts?**  
A: Please do! Just give us credit. We need the validation.

**Q: Are you going to get sued?**  
A: Not if our lawyer has anything to say about it. And we have a really good [Legal Disclaimer](/legal/).

**Q: Do you accept submissions?**  
A: Not yet, but send us your funny takes on Guyana news anyway. We might steal them and give you credit. Maybe.

**Q: How do I contact you?**  
A: Scroll down. It's right there. We promise to read your emails, especially the angry ones. Those are the most entertaining.

## Our Inspiration

We were inspired by:
- The daily absurdity of Guyana news
- The fact that four newspapers report the same event four different ways
- That one time someone tried to fix a road by putting asphalt over concrete
- Every press release that ever said "monitoring the situation"
- The 2020 elections (which aged us 20 years in 5 months)
- That chronic Georgetown traffic
- The creativity of Guyanese excuse-making
- Our therapist (we needed an outlet)

---

## What We're NOT

**We are NOT:**
- A legitimate news source (go read the actual papers for that)
- Associated with any newspaper, political party, or sane person
- Responsible for your hurt feelings
- Going to stop because you asked nicely
- Sorry for that joke that offended you (probably)

**But We ARE:**
- Committed to daily satirical roundups
- Fair in our mockery
- Accurate in our sources
- Funny (we hope)
- Here for the long haul
- Definitely getting on someone's nerves

## Join The Madness

**Ways to support us:**
1. Read our posts (you're already doing great!)
2. Share them with friends who need a laugh
3. Don't sue us
4. Seriously, don't sue us
5. Send us tomorrow's newspaper tips
6. Laugh at our jokes (even the bad ones)
7. Tell us which politician deserves tomorrow's roast

## A Serious Note

Behind all the jokes, we genuinely care about Guyana. Satire isn't just making fun - it's holding a mirror up to society and saying "look at this mess." 

We believe:
- Free speech matters
- Laughing at power is healthy
- Citizens deserve honest commentary
- Journalism needs competition
- Guyana deserves better infrastructure (seriously, fix the roads)
- Humor can spark important conversations
- Democracy needs people paying attention

If our jokes make you think while you laugh, we've done our job.

If our jokes just make you laugh, we'll take that too.

If our jokes make you angry, well... maybe that's also a conversation worth having.
