## 🗳️ BARBADOS: Mottley Rings the Bell for Round Three

**Prime Minister Mia Mottley** has called a snap election for **February 11, 2026** — a full year before she needed to.

Why the rush? Because when you've won **30-0 TWICE**, you don't wait around for the opposition to figure out how to win a seat.

The BLP has completed its slate of 30 candidates. Parliament dissolved January 19. Nomination Day is January 27. And the Democratic Labour Party? They're led by **Ralph Thorne**, a man who *defected from the BLP* in 2024.

**The Math:**
- 2018: BLP wins 30-0
- 2022: BLP wins 30-0
- 2026: BLP wins... well, you do the math

Mottley told supporters to "rest up" because when she calls, she wants to hear: "Prime Minister, we are ready. We are RED and READY."

**The Opposition's Problem:** It's hard to campaign when you don't have a single seat in Parliament. The DLP is what political analysts call "in fundamental disrepair."

**Fun Fact:** Mottley is being viewed as a leading candidate to succeed António Guterres as UN Secretary-General. Win Barbados three times, then run the world. Why not?

## ✈️ US VISA CRACKDOWN: Birth Tourism in the Crosshairs

Bad news for Caribbean moms who wanted to deliver in Miami:

The US is cracking down on **"birth tourism"** from Caribbean nations including:
- Barbados
- Trinidad and Tobago
- Jamaica
- Antigua and Barbuda
- Dominica
- Grenada

Starting 2026, pregnant travelers can expect:
- More rigorous visa interviews
- Deeper examination of "travel intent"
- Questions about medical plans and maternity costs
- Potential delays in processing

**Translation:** If you're visibly pregnant and applying for a tourist visa, you better have a VERY convincing reason why you need to see Mickey Mouse in your third trimester.

**The Bigger Picture:** This is part of broader US immigration enforcement. Citizenship-by-investment programs are also under scrutiny. The days of easy Caribbean-to-America travel may be changing.

## ✈️ CARIBBEAN AIRLINES: More Cuts, More Chaos

Caribbean Airlines is having a rough 2026:

**Routes Suspended:**
- Trinidad to Tortola
- Trinidad to San Juan  
- Dominica to Puerto Rico
- Multiple connections affected

**The Big One:** Caribbean Airlines is **closing its Barbados operational hub** in February 2026. Aircraft and crew moving to Trinidad.

**What This Means:** Longer connection times, more complex routing, higher fares on reduced competition routes.

**The Silver Lining?** Budget carrier **Avelo Airlines** is expanding into the Caribbean with flights from New Orleans, Tampa, and Providence to Cancún, Jamaica, and Dominican Republic.

**Translation:** Caribbean Airlines shrinking while American budget carriers growing. The regionalization of Caribbean air travel continues to struggle.

## 🇻🇪 VENEZUELA FALLOUT: Tourism Takes a Hit

The US-Venezuela conflict is affecting Caribbean tourism:

- Aruba  
- Barbados
- Puerto Rico
- Trinidad and Tobago

**The Issues:**
- Venezuelan airspace closed
- Flight disruptions and rerouting
- Increased travel uncertainty
- Some tourists reconsidering plans

**Trinidad Specifically:** Not directly involved, but proximity to Venezuela has raised border security concerns and shaken tourist confidence.

**The Reality:** Caribbean tourism was booming entering 2026, but geopolitical instability can change things quickly. The US FAA has banned commercial flights over Venezuelan airspace.
