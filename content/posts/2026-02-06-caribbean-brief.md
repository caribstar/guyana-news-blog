## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: IMF APPROVES US$415 MILLION EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE

The IMF executive board has approved Jamaica's request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance. The funds are meant to address urgent balance-of-payments needs. For a country that spent decades under IMF structural adjustment programmes, going back to the Fund for emergency money is like going back to your ex because the rent is due. Jamaica knows the drill — take the money, accept the conditions, and hope the economy cooperates this time.

## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: ELECTION DAY SET FOR FEBRUARY 11

Barbados is heating up politically with general elections scheduled for next Wednesday. Schools will be closed on election day, early voting is already underway, and PM Mottley has been publicly slamming opposition figure Ralph Thorne over a Trinidad media interview.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: PM PERSAD-BISSESSAR DOUBLES DOWN ON CARICOM CRITICISM

Trinidad and Tobago's PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar used Parliament to call for a transformation of CARICOM, doubling down on her criticism of the regional body. She's also set to address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid a multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge. T&T is simultaneously telling CARICOM it needs to change while positioning itself as the region's energy capital. Classic Trinidad move — criticize the family reunion while bringing the best food.

## 🇭🇹 HAITI: CARICOM REBUKES TRANSITIONAL LEADERSHIP

In a rare and sharply worded statement, Caribbean leaders have placed Haiti's transitional leadership under renewed regional scrutiny. The rebuke targets caretaker Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils amid efforts to remove him. Haiti continues to be the region's most heartbreaking crisis — a nation with enormous potential trapped in a cycle of political instability, violence, and international neglect. The US ruling on Temporary Protected Status reflects Haiti's deepening crisis, with Doctors Without Borders noting the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.

## 🇱🇨 US DENIES ASKING ST LUCIA TO STOP CUBA MEDICAL PROGRAMME

The US Government has denied asking St Lucia to stop sending nationals to Cuba for medical studies. This comes amid growing US pressure across the region on Cuba-related programmes. Caribbean nations have long relied on Cuban medical training as an affordable option — telling small island states to stop is like telling them to stop swimming in the ocean because you don't like the water.
