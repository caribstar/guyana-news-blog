## Good morning from Queens! 🇬🇾🇺🇸

Alright, alright. Me nephew does write that Daily Brief thing and sometimes he too cynical for he own good. Let me tell you what REALLY happening in Guyana right now.

Because while people busy complaining, this government BUILDING.

## 💻 DIGITISATION: THIS IS REAL PROGRESS

Minister Zulfikar Ally just outlined the most ambitious digital transformation I've seen from any Caribbean government:

**Skills Connect App** — Linking workers directly with employers. No more middleman. No more "who you know" politics.

**Citizen Connect** (launching soon) — You can report issues, give feedback, get real-time updates. Government accountability at your fingertips.

**Digital Appointments** — Schedule meetings with ministries online. No more lining up from 5 AM.

The Minister said it perfectly: *"A government that manages billions can no longer rely on paper files and disconnected systems."*

And he's right! You cyah run a 21st-century economy with 20th-century systems. The opposition still talking about the past while the PPP building the future.

## 🏠 HOUSING: THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE

Minister Colin Croal laid it out clear: Region Four has **52,142 pending housing applicants**. That's not bias — that's MATH.

When people say the government showing favouritism, check the actual data:
- Region 10: 2,315 allocations
- Region 4: Largest backlog in the country

The Minister called it "real performance, not theatrics." And he's right. The opposition broke the housing sector from 2015-2020. Now the PPP cleaning up the mess AND building new.

## 📈 GDP GROWTH IS PRODUCTION, NOT SPENDING

President Ali schooled the critics on basic economics, and me heart was warm.

He said: *"GDP measures production, not payment. If non-oil GDP is growing, it is because businesses are producing more, not because government is spending more."*

**FACTS.**

Construction up. Manufacturing up. Agriculture up. Services up. Transport up. Trade up.

The critics calling it "government spending" because they don't understand macroeconomics. President Ali called them "parrots" and honestly? Fair.

## 🏥 GPHC LAB: 35 DAYS TO 24 HOURS

This is the story the opposition cyah touch.

Two years ago, pathology results took **35 days**. TODAY: urgent cases done in **24 hours**. Standard cases in 7 days.

That's:
- ISO 15189 Plus accreditation (international standard)
- $474 million government investment
- New equipment, trained staff, modern systems

**PEOPLE ARE GETTING DIAGNOSED FASTER AND TREATED SOONER.**

But opposition MPs in Parliament want to talk about everything except results.

## 🏟️ BAYROC STADIUM SATURDAY

Linden getting a world-class stadium. One of FIVE regional stadiums opening this year.

- Athletics championship
- Georgetown vs. Linden football
- Pre-Mashramani concert

This is what investment looks like. This is what believing in Guyana looks like.

## 🛒 $2 BILLION FOR STABROEK & BOURDA

Finally! These markets have needed renovation for DECADES. Minister Sukhai announced $2 billion to begin reconstruction.

This is about:
- Safety for vendors
- Modernisation for customers
- Preserving our heritage
- Growing the creative economy

The PPP delivering what others only promised.

---

## 🌍 FOREIGN POLICY NEVER STOPS

Minister Hugh Todd reminded the opposition: while they busy criticising, the PPP has:
- Processed 17,000 passports for diaspora in 5 years
- Increased Foreign Affairs budget by 88%
- Maintained Guyana's reputation internationally

And he correctly pointed out that the opposition elected an Opposition Leader who's **indicted in the United States**. That's their quality of democratic representation?

---

## 💰 GOLD SECTOR RESURRECTED

Minister Bharrat brought the facts:
- 2024: +1,954 ounces
- 2025: +50,254 ounces
- Gold now over $5,000/ounce

The sector was DYING under APNU. Now it's recovering. And President Ali is personally going to Region Seven Friday to meet with miners and enforce compliance.

THAT'S leadership.

## 📚 GUYANA DIGITAL SCHOOL EXPANDS

The nationwide school outreach program is bringing digital education to students across the country. President Ali's vision becoming reality.

This is about:
- Flexible learning
- Technology-driven education
- Preparing young people for the future

The opposition cyah complain about this one, so they won't mention it.

## MY TAKE

Look, I know the Daily Brief does make jokes about everything. And some things deserve scrutiny — that tragedy at Water Street is heartbreaking and needs proper investigation.

But when I look at the big picture:
- Digital transformation happening
- Housing being built
- Healthcare improving
- Stadiums going up
- Markets getting fixed
- Economy growing

**This government is WORKING.**

The opposition can't match it. So they focus on personality attacks, procedural complaints, and pretending the Mohameds are victims instead of facing serious charges.

President Ali said it: *"We are not managing the present. We are building the future."*

And from where I sit in Queens, I can see it happening.

**Uncle Ramesh out.** 🇬🇾

*Tell your mudda I said hello. And register for that Skills Connect app when it launches!*
