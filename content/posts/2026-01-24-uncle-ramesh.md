*A diaspora perspective from Queens, NY*

## FROM QUEENS WITH PRIDE 🇬🇾

Good morning from Richmond Hill! Waking up this Saturday to some EXCELLENT news from back home, and I just have to share with my fellow patriotic Guyanese in the diaspora!

## 💰 BUDGET 2026: ANOTHER HISTORIC MOMENT COMING!

While some negative people complaining about Budget 2026, I watching from here and seeing PROGRESS. 

You know how many budgets the PNC delivered when they was in power? Budgets that drove people like ME out of Guyana to come and struggle in Queens? Now look at us — we have oil money, we have investments, we have DEVELOPMENT!

The opposition saying "don't borrow too much" — but let me ask you something: When you building a mansion, you does complain about the mortgage? NO! You invest in your future!

President Ali and Dr. Ashni Singh know what they doing. Trust the process!

## 🏭 BARAMA $1 BILLION INVESTMENT — THIS IS WHAT VISION LOOKS LIKE!

One BILLION dollars going into plywood production! Local manufacturing! Job creation! 

My cousin Priya son just graduate from UTG — you think he would have opportunities like this under PNC? He would be driving taxi in Brooklyn by now! Instead, he can stay home and build Guyana!

The opposition can't even come up with a shadow budget, but Barama dropping billions. That's the difference between talkers and doers!

## 🌱 SHADE HOUSE PROJECT — FOOD SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY!

President Ali just launched a shade house project in Georgetown. Some people laughing at it on social media, but these are the same people who does complain when tomatoes expensive!

You can't have it both ways! Either we grow our own food or we import and pay high prices. The President thinking TEN STEPS AHEAD while the opposition still trying to figure out who gon be Opposition Leader!

When I was growing up in Berbice, my grandmother used to grow everything in the backyard. Now we modernizing that tradition with technology. THAT is progress!

## 🚗 MINISTER EDGHILL CLEANING UP THE ROADS

Finally! Somebody taking action on these derelict vehicles! I come back to Guyana last December for my niece wedding, and every corner had some bruk-down car sitting there like decoration.

Minister Edghill say "TOTAL DISRESPECT" and he right! We building world-class infrastructure and people leaving their junk vehicles to rust in public? Not anymore!

THIS is the kind of decisive action we need. The opposition would form a committee to discuss the committee that would discuss the vehicles. Edghill just say REMOVE THEM. I like that energy!

## 🗑️ SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT — FINALLY ADDRESSING THE REAL ISSUES

Minister Manickchand spearheading consultations on waste management. You know how long Guyanese been complaining about garbage? Under PNC, the whole country was a dump site!

Now we have proper consultations, proper legislation coming, proper systems being built. This is governance! This is leadership!

My WhatsApp group from Guyana always sending pictures of clean roads, new buildings, development happening. The opposition can't show nothing like that from 2015-2020. Nothing but blackouts and empty shelves!

---

## ✈️ GCAA DIRECTORS GETTING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION

Two GCAA directors just named ICAO Global Ambassadors! ICAO — the International Civil Aviation Organization! GLOBAL recognition for Guyanese!

Under this government, our professionals getting respected worldwide. We not just producing oil — we producing excellence!

But you won't see the opposition celebrating this. They only know how to criticize and complain.

## 👀 ABOUT THIS OPPOSITION LEADER SITUATION...

Look, I not going to talk too much on this one, because the situation speak for itself.

APNU can't even decide whether to vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Twelve seats in Parliament and no strategy! 

And the WIN leader... well... let's just say when I'm sending remittances back home, I make sure my family using legitimate channels! 

The contrast is clear: A government that's WORKING versus an opposition that can't even ORGANIZE.

## 📞 MESSAGE TO MY DIASPORA FAMILY

To all my Guyanese brothers and sisters in New York, Toronto, London, Miami — 

Don't let the negative people fool you! Go home and see for yourself! The Guyana I left in the 90s is NOT the Guyana today!

New roads, new hospitals, new schools, new opportunities. Our children can have a FUTURE at home now.

I already planning to build my retirement house in Guyana. My son? He's considering moving back to start a business. THAT is the confidence this government has created!

Keep sending your support. Keep investing. Keep believing!

One Guyana! One People! One Destiny! 🇬🇾
