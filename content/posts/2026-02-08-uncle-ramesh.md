Eh eh! Good morning, good morning! Uncle Ramesh here, fresh cup of bush tea in hand, Sunday papers spread out on de table like a feast. And what a feast it is!

First thing first — leh me address this Budget debate nonsense. The Opposition Leader get up in Parliament and say the budget "won't lift the masses out of poverty." Boy, this man talking like he ain't see the $100,000 cash grant, the zero-interest loans, the school buildings going up left right and centre. A $298 million primary school going to St. Cuthbert's Mission! You know how long dem children waiting for a proper school? But no — according to the opposition, nothing happening. Dem could be standing inside a brand new hospital and still say "where de development?"

Now, Finance Minister Dr. Singh — that man wrap up the budget debate like a lawyer closing a murder case. He bring facts, figures, and then casually mention Pablo Escobar. PABLO ESCOBAR! In Parliament! You know you winning the argument when you pulling out Colombian drug lord references and nobody could say you wrong. The man simply quoted public documents. That is called homework, people. Try it sometime.

And look at this — $25.4 BILLION invested in green energy! Renewable capacity up SEVENFOLD! Amelia Falls hydropower moving forward! A 300-megawatt power plant coming! This is the PPP/C doing what they always do — building the foundation while the opposition busy writing press releases. When that power plant come online and you getting 24-hour current, remember who build it. Not the people who was busy trying to get sworn in as opposition leader for six months.

The GPHC miracle birth story warm me heart, boy. Doctors at Georgetown Public Hospital saving mother and baby from a rare bleeding disorder — that is the real Guyana story. Not the noise in Parliament. The real heroes wearing scrubs, not suits.

And President Ali telling the GDF "don't blink" on Venezuela? THAT is leadership. You don't wait for trouble to come knocking before you oil the hinges. You stay ready. This government building capacity across EVERY domain — technology, intelligence, defence. While Maduro situation still shaky, Guyana standing firm. That is what a real Commander-in-Chief sound like.

Black History Month celebrations happening proper — 400 years of African presence in Guyana! ACDA doing excellent work with the schools, the exhibitions, the cultural preservation. This government investing in EVERY community, EVERY heritage. $5 billion allocated for women and youth economic projects in Indigenous communities. Carbon credit revenues reaching 253 villages. THIS is what inclusive development look like.

The Cuba medical partnership changes? Look — the government adapted to international realities while KEEPING the medical programme running. Cuban doctors still here, still working, still saving lives. The scholarship programme continuing. That is called pragmatic governance. You adjust the method, you keep the result.

Now, the opposition MP saying $25,000 a month public assistance "keeps people poor." Boy, who was in government when public assistance was LESS than that? Who had FIVE YEARS to raise it and didn't? Easy to complain from the sidelines when you had your turn at bat and struck out looking.

Minister Indar lay it out plain — every sector rising. Manufacturing up. Aviation expanding. $800 million for airport upgrades. $6.3 billion for dredging the Demerara River. This ain't talk. This is concrete, steel, and progress you could measure with a ruler.

So enjoy your Sunday, Guyana. The budget passed. The schools going up. The power coming. The cricket started — Hetmyer already blazing! And Uncle Ramesh going and watch the match with a Banks and some pholourie.

PPP/C putting people first. Always been. Always will be. 🇬🇾
