## 4-MINUTE SCRIPT (~600 words)

Good day everyone, welcome to the Guyana Daily Brief for Tuesday, February 10th, 2026.

Let's start with the big diplomatic story. President Ali visited the State of Roraima in Brazil on Monday and received the Medalha Forte São Joaquim — that's Roraima's highest honour. He met with Governor Denarium and two Brazilian senators, talking about removing trade barriers, improving cross-border connectivity, and energy collaboration. The Guyana-Brazil corridor has real economic potential, especially with Lethem as a gateway. Whether the infrastructure catches up to the ambition remains the question.

Now to the National Assembly, where the Committee of Supply got busy examining the 2026 budget estimates. Several eye-catching numbers emerged. The Commissioner of Information was allocated 40 million dollars, despite the fact that Commissioner Charles Ramson Senior has not produced annual reports to Parliament in more than a decade. Opposition MP Terrence Campbell pressed Minister Teixeira on this, but got no satisfaction.

The Opposition Leader's Office was allocated 34 million. But Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed says he STILL hasn't received basic provisions like a vehicle or security detail, weeks after his election. Speaking of Mohamed — his extradition hearing was postponed Monday because he's unwell. But the real story is that a Permanent Secretary admitted under cross-examination that a SECOND US extradition request was received in November 2025. Minister Hugh Todd denied it publicly. Somebody's version of events isn't accurate.

On the education front, Minister Teixeira confirmed there are 2,800 senior teacher vacancies across the public school system. That's a staggering number that speaks to both expansion and chronic recruitment challenges.

New housing and agricultural lands are supposed to come on stream from June, with 119 million budgeted for surveys. And 645 police officers are being considered for promotion, though the Police Service Commission itself needs new appointments after two members passed away.

GECOM has published the Revised List of Electors for 21 days of public scrutiny ahead of Local Government Elections. Funds have been set aside from the 6.9 billion dollar GECOM allocation. But the commission has multiple key vacancies and reportedly hasn't been meeting regularly due to questions about commissioner representation since the emergence of WIN as a major opposition force.

Stabroek's editorial tackled the Data Protection Act — passed in August 2023 but only now, 30 months later, is a Commissioner being appointed. The paper noted that contact information provided for the 100,000 dollar cash grant was allegedly used by PPP operatives to solicit votes before the September 2025 elections.

WIN MP Sarabo-Halley raised concerns about a 6.6 billion dollar regional hospital that's already flooding just six months after being commissioned. No engineering assessment has been released.

On a positive note, the Kato Hydropower Plant is now fully operational, powering 24 community buildings and employing 17 residents. And 158 contractors have bid for 10 billion dollars in infrastructure works at Leonora — a sign of serious private sector engagement.

In crime news, three 9mm pistols and cannabis were found during a Linden raid, with two arrested. And the Bayroc National Stadium officially opened in Linden on Saturday — the town's first proper track and field facility.

Across the Caribbean, Barbados goes to the polls tomorrow. Jamaica mourns the passing of Third World co-founder Cat Coore. And West Indies opened the T20 World Cup with a win over Scotland.
