## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: NINE DAYS TO ELECTION DAY

The February 11 general election is now **nine days away**, and Barbados is in full campaign mode.

Prime Minister Mia Mottley is seeking a **historic third consecutive term** after leading the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) to back-to-back 30-0 sweeps in 2018 and 2022. The opposition Democratic Labour Party (DLP), now led by Ralph Thorne — a former BLP member who defected in 2024 — is trying to break the streak.

Five parties have filed candidates: BLP, DLP, Reform Barbados, Friends of Democracy, and the People's Coalition for Progress (an alliance of three smaller parties). The PCP is running 15 candidates and wants to reduce the number of constituencies from 30.

Political analyst Peter Wickham summed up the race this way: the question isn't whether Mottley wins, it's whether the DLP can win even ONE seat. That's the level of dominance we're talking about.

Mottley is running on 17 consecutive quarters of economic growth and record foreign reserves. Her message to supporters: "We are red and ready."

The DLP's message: "Please just give us a chance this time."

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: POLICE SHOOTING SPARKS NATIONAL OUTRAGE

Trinidad and Tobago is in uproar after CCTV footage showed police officers shooting 31-year-old Joshua Samaroo as he appeared to be surrendering with his hands in the air after a car chase. His common-law wife, Kaia Sealy, was also shot and is now paralysed.

The footage showed at least 17 shots fired at the vehicle after it crashed. The Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago (LATT) has questioned Commissioner of Police Allister Guevarro's decision not to suspend the officers, noting the footage showed neither occupant engaging in gunfire.

This is the **fourth police killing** in Trinidad for 2026 — following a trend where fatal police shootings went from 45 in 2023 to 54 in 2024 to 68 in 2025. The officers have since been moved off field duty.

The family is calling for an independent investigation, and the country is asking hard questions about the use of deadly force during what was nine months of states of emergency in 2025.

Meanwhile, the government is pushing to replace the expired state of emergency with "zones of special operations" — essentially the same powers with a different name.

## 🎭 CARNIVAL SEASON: THE ISLANDS ARE VIBRATING

It's that time of year. Trinidad Carnival is approaching fast, and the soca, chutney, and steelpan are in full rotation.

Highlights from the carnival buildup include the Passage to Asia fete, the WND Park Race cycling season opener, and pan prelims across the country. Chutney soca singer Wackerman has a new socially conscious entry for 2026.

For those planning to head down: accommodation is filling up FAST. The ferry service between Trinidad and Tobago has been dealing with vessel issues — the recently leased Blue Wave Harmony was reportedly damaged — but the government says operations haven't been disrupted.

Minister of Culture Michelle Benjamin says she's "determined to evolve and enhance the cultural sector." Translation: bigger fetes, more funding, and probably a new Ministry selfie at every event.

## 🏏 CRICKET: WEST INDIES PREP FOR T20 WORLD CUP

Afghanistan and West Indies are set to tune up for the **T20 World Cup** (starting February 7 in India and Sri Lanka) with a three-match T20I series in Dubai.

The conditions in Dubai should be "fairly comparable" to the subcontinent — which is cricket-speak for "at least it's not England."

Back in Guyana, women's cricket is thriving — Guyana defeated Jamaica in the CWI Women's Blaze T20 Championships, though they suffered a heartbreaking 7-run loss to the Leeward Islands.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: DISABILITIES ACT TAKES EFFECT

Jamaica's **Disabilities Act** comes into effect today, marking a major step forward for the rights of persons with disabilities on the island. The government celebrated with events across Kingston.

In other Jamaica news, PM Andrew Holness has been urging Jamaicans to "focus on building a future at home" after the US paused immigrant visas for 75 countries, including Jamaica. The economy grew 5.1% in the July-September 2025 quarter, and the US recently lowered its travel advisory for Jamaica to Level 2.

## 🌊 REGIONAL ROUNDUP

**Antigua & Barbuda:** Contracting over 100 nurses from Ghana while insisting they haven't "ended" their existing nursing arrangements. Cabinet also confirmed there's no dengue outbreak despite rumours.

**Haiti:** Bishop Pierre-André Dumas withdrew from a proposed national mediation process aimed at preventing instability ahead of the transitional government's deadline. As one Haitian comedian put it: "Even the Church gave up on us."

**St. Vincent:** Strengthening surveillance of La Soufrière volcano. When your biggest worry is literally the ground exploding, everything else seems manageable.

**Dominica:** Launched "Glory in Paradise," a new national gospel festival. Proof that faith and tourism can coexist — usually on the same dance floor.

## 💭 REGIONAL THOUGHT

Nine days until Barbados votes. Five days until the T20 World Cup. Trinidad counting police shootings while counting down to Carnival. And Guyana debating a trillion-dollar budget.

The Caribbean stays busy, stays complicated, and stays resilient. One region, one family. 🌴
