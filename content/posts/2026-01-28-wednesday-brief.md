## 🎯 THE BIG STORY: The Fugitive Has Landed

Well, it's official. **Azruddin Mohamed** is now Guyana's Opposition Leader.

Yes, THAT Azruddin Mohamed — the one the US Treasury Department sanctioned, the one facing a Florida indictment for gold smuggling and money laundering, the one Speaker Nadir called an "international fugitive" for weeks.

The vote on Monday saw 17 opposition MPs — 16 from WIN and 1 lonely soul from another party — elect him to the constitutional post. The PNC apparently decided that endorsing a man wanted by America is a great way to rebuild relations with Guyana's most important diplomatic partner.

ABC News called him "a Guyanese businessman facing extradition to the US." We call him "the most interesting Opposition Leader in Guyanese history."

**The Irony:** The US helped neutralize Venezuela's Maduro, who allegedly had ties to... wait for it... the Mohameds. But sure, let's make one of them Opposition Leader. What could go wrong?

## 💰 BUDGET 2026: The Goodies Keep Coming

Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh dropped Budget 2026 on Monday, and the government hasn't stopped talking about it since. Here's what's on the table:

**Cash in Your Pocket:**
- **$100,000 cash grant** for every Guyanese 18 and older (that's $60 BILLION pumped into the economy)
- **Because We Care** increased to $60,000 per child
- **Transportation Grant** of $20,000 for schoolchildren
- **Old Age Pension** up from $41,000 to $46,000 monthly
- **Public Assistance** up from $22,000 to $25,000 monthly

**Tax Relief:**
- Income tax threshold raised from $130,000 to $140,000 (5,000 people off the tax register!)
- Net property tax ABOLISHED for individuals
- Flat tax on double-cab pickups ($2M for under 2000cc, $3M for 2000-2500cc)

**For the Entrepreneurs:**
- Guyana Development Bank getting US$200 million injection
- Zero-interest, zero-collateral loans up to $3 million for youth, women, and persons with disabilities

President Ali says Budget 2026 is "positioned with the people at the centre." Opposition says it's "skewed allocation of resources." Guyanese say: "Where do I sign up for my $100,000?"

## 🏠 HOUSING: 15,000 Lots, 8,000 Homes

The housing machine keeps churning. Budget 2026 promises:

- **15,000 new house lots** distributed nationwide
- **8,000 new homes** constructed
- Focus on reducing the backlog OUTSIDE Region Four

Minister Singh said the government's investments are "not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride."

Translation: They're building entire neighbourhoods, not just houses. Whether that means better planning or just more promises remains to be seen.

## ✈️ TOURISM: Record Arrivals and Hotel Boom

Good news for anyone who's ever complained there's nowhere to stay in Guyana:

- **453,489 visitors** in 2025 — highest EVER recorded
- **9 international-standard hotels** opened in 5 years
- **Plaza Court Hotel** (US$18M, 60 rooms) just opened on Main Street
- **Air Transat** now flying twice weekly to Toronto
- **$2.2 billion** for the new Hospitality and Tourism Institute

President Ali at the Plaza Court opening: "Guyana is not waiting for a tourism boom. The boom has already begun."

He also reminded hotels to "collaborate, not compete" to sell "Brand Guyana." 

**The Reality Check:** With all these hotels opening, let's hope the tourists actually come. Otherwise, we'll have very nice empty buildings.

## 🏫 OPPOSITION DRAMA: Tabatinga School "Far From Ready"

APNU and WIN visited the Tabatinga Secondary School construction site and came away unimpressed.

MP Sherod Duncan said the school was "far from operational readiness."

The government has been touting new schools as part of their education push. The opposition says the reality doesn't match the rhetoric.

Who's right? Well, that depends on which newspaper you're reading.

## 📊 QUICK HITS

**Roraima Airways** announced a 7% reduction in airfares to rehabilitated hinterland airstrips. Your uncle in Lethem can now visit for slightly less.

**China-Guyana health partnership** deepening with new therapies and plans to address obesity in 2026. Yes, obesity is now on the agenda.

**Ministry of Human Services** launching campaign to help pensioners transition from pension book payments. Digital Guyana continues.

**2022 Census** shows population surge to 878,674 — up 131,719 from 2012. APNU questions the integrity of the data. Of course they do.
