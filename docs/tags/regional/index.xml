&lt;h2 id="-jamaica-gets-us415-million-imf-emergency-loan">🇯🇲 Jamaica Gets US$415 Million IMF Emergency Loan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The IMF Executive Board has approved Jamaica&amp;rsquo;s request for emergency financial assistance of approximately &lt;strong>US$415 million&lt;/strong> to help meet urgent balance-of-payments needs. This comes as the region continues to navigate economic pressures from various global factors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jamaica&amp;rsquo;s Finance Minister is expected to outline how these funds will be deployed to stabilize the economy and protect vulnerable populations. The country has been a model for IMF structural adjustment programs in the past, but this emergency assistance signals ongoing challenges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Caribbean Weekly Roundup: IMF Bailout for Jamaica, US Visa Crackdown, and Caribbean Airlines Chaos</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-27-caribbean-brief/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-27-caribbean-brief/</guid><description>Jamaica secures $415M IMF emergency funds, Caribbean Airlines closes Barbados hub, US cracks down on birth tourism across the region, and Venezuela conflict ripples through Caribbean tourism.</description></item><item><title>Caribbean Daily Brief — January 21, 2026</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-21-caribbean-brief/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-21-caribbean-brief/</guid><description>Jamaica secures US$6.7 billion for Hurricane Melissa recovery, Maduro claims presidency from Brooklyn jail, Haiti TPS termination hearing continues, and Trinidad welcomes new PM Stuart Young.</description></item><item><title>Caribbean Daily Brief – January 20, 2026</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-20-caribbean-brief/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-20-caribbean-brief/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Your 5-minute tour of regional chaos, served with rum punch&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two weeks after Uncle Sam yoinked Nicolás Maduro out of Caracas like a bad tooth, the Caribbean is still dealing with the hangover. Thousands of tourists got stranded. Cruise ships played musical chairs in Barbados harbour. And Trinidad?

PM Kamla then spent the weekend cussing out the Energy Chamber for allegedly caring more about foreign oil companies than local contractors. Classic Trini Monday.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
