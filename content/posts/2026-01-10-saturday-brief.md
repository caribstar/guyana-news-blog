## ðŸŽ­ STORY #1: THE MOHAMEDS PRESENT: "VICTIM: THE MUSICAL"

**Opening Scene:** Nazar Mohamed, fresh from discovering that being indicted for fraud is "oppression," has penned a heartfelt op-ed. Think Les MisÃ©rables, but the convict owns bulletproof cars.

**What The Papers Said:**

<div style="border: 2px dashed #009E60; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; background: #f9f9f9;">
<p><strong style="color: #CE1126;">KAIETEUR:</strong> Gave him the entire front page. "THIS IS NOT LAW, THIS IS OPPRESSION!" (Also Kaieteur: sold more papers that day)</p>
<p><strong style="color: #009E60;">CHRONICLE:</strong> "Prosecution wants earlier date" (translation: Florida is TIRED)</p>
<p><strong>STABROEK:</strong> Mysteriously silent (lawyers probably said "don't touch this")</p>
<p><strong>GUYANA TIMES:</strong> "Case adjourned to February 5" (just the facts, ma'am)</p>
</div>

**The Plot Twist:** While Mohamed writes 2,000 words about persecution, the prosecution is literally begging: "Can we PLEASE do this sooner?" and the defense lawyers are like "Sorry, we're washing our hair until February."

**Mohamed's Grievances Include:**
- Insurance companies won't cover his bulletproof vehicles anymore (the AUDACITY)
- GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping him commit fraud, but details!)
- His lands are being "illegally occupied" (by people who probably have actual legal papers)
- The government is using "political influence" (from the guy indicted for using business influence)

**The Persecution-O-Meter:**

<div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #CE1126; margin: 20px 0;">
<div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #CE1126 0%, #CE1126 98%, #ddd 98%, #ddd 100%); height: 30px; border-radius: 5px; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); color: white; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12px;">98% Victim / 2% Consequences</span>
</div>
<p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;"><strong>Actual Persecution:</strong> Being asked to answer fraud charges</p>
<p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;"><strong>Mohamed's Persecution:</strong> Everything including gravity</p>
<p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;"><strong>Next Court Date:</strong> February 5 (unless they file to delay the delay)</p>
</div>

## âš¡ STORY #2: CONTRACTOR DISCOVERS ELECTRICITY THE HARD WAY

**Breaking:** RZND Concrete Company decided to play "How Close Can We Get to 69,000 Volts Before Someone Arrests Us?"

**Spoiler Alert:** Not very close!

**The Setup:**
- GPL has a 69,000-volt transmission line
- This line connects Sophia to Good Hope (keeps Regions 4 & 5 from becoming candlelit dinner zones)
- Contractor extends concrete pump DIRECTLY OVER IT
- GPL: "ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!"

**GPL's Strongly Worded Letter:**

<div style="background: black; color: #00ff00; padding: 20px; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
<pre>
â•”â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•—

</pre>
</div>

**Best Part:** This is the SECOND time in THREE MONTHS! Last time, someone tried to move a police station and hit power lines. 

**New Guyana Construction Checklist:**
- [ ] Get construction permit
- [ ] Check for underground utilities  
- [ ] Check for OVERHEAD UTILITIES (we keep forgetting this one!)
- [ ] Maybe ask "will this plunge 100,000 people into darkness?"
- [ ] Call GPL at 226-2600 (this number is in the press release for a reason!)

## ðŸ“ˆ STORY #3: 2025 STATISTICS - A HORROR STORY

**Murders:** â¬†ï¸ UP 11% (130 people dead)

**Road Deaths:** â¬†ï¸ UP 6% (137 people dead)

**Total Accidents:** â¬‡ï¸ DOWN 10%

**Wait... WHAT?**

<div style="background: #FCD116; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border: 3px solid #CE1126;">
<p><strong>GPF:</strong> "Great news! Accidents are DOWN!"</p>
<p><strong>Also GPF:</strong> "Bad news! Deaths are UP!"</p>
<p><strong>Us:</strong> "How does that evenâ€”"</p>
<p><strong>GPF:</strong> "We're as confused as you are."</p>
<p><strong>World Bank:</strong> "Your 15 deaths per 100,000 is UNACCEPTABLY HIGH"</p>
<p><strong>Government:</strong> "We'll get it to 50 total by 2030!"</p>
<p><strong>Current Trajectory:</strong> Going from 137 to 50... by adding more each year? Bold strategy!</p>
</div>

**Translation:** We're having FEWER crashes, but when we crash, we're doing it PROFESSIONALLY. Quality over quantity, apparently.

**Government's Road Safety Plan:**
- Install cameras âœ“
- Issue e-tickets âœ“
- Hope really hard âœ“
- Actually fix roads âŒ
- Driver education âŒ

## ðŸŽ¬ STORY #4: GUYANA TOURISM PRESENTS: "DON'T FILM THIS"

**Act 1: The British Vlogger**

Ellis Riding arrives in Georgetown with a camera. Films garbage dumps, street people, and dangerous areas. Says Guyana is "one of the most Third World places" he's seen.

**Chronicle's Response:** Publishes 1,000-word column calling him a "10th-rate British foot-traveller" with "rotten mentality" who's "probably paid by the opposition."

**Chronicle's Defense:** "It's dangerous in Miami too!" (This is the new national slogan apparently)

**Act 2: The French Vlogger**

Antony D'Oliveira is filming. Vendor Quacy McKay doesn't want to be filmed. Logical response? SLAP HIM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

**McKay's Court Explanation:** "I was just trying to move the camera!" 

**Judge:** "Sir, that's not how cameras work."

**Bail:** ,000

**Tourism Guyana's New Slogan Ideas:**

<div style="background: #CE1126; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; text-align: center;">
<h3 style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;">ðŸŽ¥ UPDATED TOURISM WARNINGS</h3>

<p style="margin: 8px 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Film reality:</strong> Chronicle will question your ancestry</p>
<p style="margin: 8px 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Film a vendor:</strong> That's a slappin'</p>
<p style="margin: 8px 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Complain:</strong> "But Miami though!"</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">Guyana: Come for the oil, leave with assault charges!</p>

## ðŸ—ï¸ STORY #5: VP ANNOUNCES INFINITY HOUSES

**The Grand Plan:** Build 40,000 houses in 5 years!

**The Math They Should've Done:**

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border: 3px solid #009E60; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 10px 0;"><strong>40,000 houses Ã· 5 years = 8,000/year</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 10px 0;"><strong>8,000 Ã· 365 days = 22 HOUSES PER DAY</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 10px 0;"><strong>22 houses Ã· 24 hours = ONE HOUSE EVERY 65 MINUTES</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 15px 0 0 0; color: #CE1126;"><strong>AROUND THE CLOCK. NO BREAKS. NO WEEKENDS. FOR FIVE YEARS.</strong></p>
</div>

**One Letter Writer's Take:**

<div style="background: #fff; border-left: 4px solid #CE1126; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 17px;">"This is ludicrous and comical... tantamount to putting 10 pounds grocery in a 5-pound bag"</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Problems He Identified:</strong></p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li>No zoning laws (houses wherever!)</li>
<li>No building codes (walls optional!)</li>
<li>No inspections (safety is a social construct!)</li>
<li>The dreaded 4 S's: <strong>Sliding, Slipping, Sagging, Sinking</strong></li>
<li>Land titles take forever and cost a fortune</li>
<li>Poor roads, garbage everywhere, water scarce</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: bold;">His Verdict: "Another colossal failure in the making"</p>
</div>

**Previous Government "Trust Me Bro" Projects:**
- âŒ Amaila Falls Hydropower (fell through)
- âŒ Surendra Hospital (still not sure what happened)
- âŒ Skeldon Sugar Factory (sweet disaster)
- ðŸŽ² 40,000 Houses (place your bets now!)

## ðŸ’¡ STORY #6: THE ELECTRICITY PROMISE ENTERS THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM

**October 2024:** "I promise to cut electricity by 50% before end of 2025!" - President Ali

**January 2026:** *crickets*

**Current Situation:**

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ffebee 0%, #ffcdd2 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border: 2px solid #CE1126;">
<p><strong>Month 1 Bill:</strong> ,000</p>
<p><strong>Month 2 Bill (same usage):</strong> ,000</p>
<p><strong>GPL Explanation:</strong> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>
<p><strong>Citizens:</strong> "Can you explain the difference?"</p>
<p><strong>GPL:</strong> *currently dealing with contractors trying to blow up transmission lines*</p>
<p><strong>President's Promise:</strong> Last seen heading to the airport with a fake mustache</p>
</div>

**May 2025 Quote:** "Infrastructure transformation beyond anyone's wildest imagination!"

**January 2026 Reality:** Bills still wildly unpredictable, Heroes Highway needs repairs after 2 years, and we almost lost power because someone extended a concrete pump.

**Wildest Imagination Status:** Confirmed.

## ðŸ¤« STORY #7: HAS ANYONE SEEN THE OPPOSITION?

**Last Spotted:** Norton gave a press conference about deportees

**Current Status:** MISSING

**Kaieteur's Editorial:** "Calling the opposition, calling the opposition"

<div style="background: #000; color: #fff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: monospace;">

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Should be loud and oppositional</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT BEHAVIOR:</strong> Suspiciously quiet</p>
<p><strong>IF FOUND:</strong> Please remind them about:</p>
<ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
<li>Electricity bills still high</li>
<li>22 houses per day is impossible</li>
<li>Murders up 11%</li>
<li>Road deaths increasing</li>
<li>Heroes Highway already needs fixing</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>REWARD:</strong> A functioning democracy</p>
</div>

**Kaieteur's Savage Quote:** "It is almost as if the opposition in Guyana is in [the PPP's] fold, under its control"

**Ouch.**

## ðŸ’­ WEEKEND WISDOM

In a country where a man indicted for  fraud writes op-eds about oppression while contractors treat power lines like suggestions and the government promises to build one house every 65 minutes for five straight years...

**At least we're building airstrips and the lights are still on.**

*Barely.*

**Stay safe, Guyana. And contractors? FOR THE LOVE OF GPL, CALL BEFORE YOU BUILD! ðŸ“ž**
