## 60-SECOND SCRIPT (~150 words)

Hey everybody! It's Friday in Guyana and things getting real spicy!

President Ali just told the army "don't blink" when it comes to Venezuela. He says the threat isn't going anywhere and Guyana needs to stay ready. New boats coming end of this month and drones expanding — at least the military upgrading even if the roads still have potholes!

Meanwhile in Parliament, an MP fractured her ankle just walking to her seat! The budget debate is so rough even the floor fighting back!

Police burned 53,000 cannabis plants in Linden — eight whole acres of weed! No arrests though. Whoever running that farm probably watching from across the river with binoculars.

Tourism up 17.2 percent — nearly 35,000 visitors in January. And the T20 World Cup starts TOMORROW with six Guyanese in the West Indies squad!

That's your Friday roundup — have a great weekend Guyana!

## 4-MINUTE SCRIPT (~600 words)

Hey Guyana! Welcome to your Friday news roundup. We got a LOT to cover today so let's jump right in.

First up — Venezuela. President Ali addressed the GDF Officers' Conference yesterday and he wasn't playing around. He told the army straight: "Guyana must not drop its guard. Guyana must not blink." He said even though there's political upheaval in Venezuela right now with the US getting involved, that doesn't reduce the threat to Essequibo one bit. The GDF Chief, Brigadier Omar Khan, backed him up saying border defence is "non-negotiable." They got new boats being tested, drones expanding, and the President wants the army thinking beyond just traditional military — cybersecurity, environmental protection, undersea cables. Basically, if it involves protecting Guyana's interests, the GDF needs to be on it.

Now the budget debate — Day Four and boy, it's getting heated. The Deputy Speaker Dr. Mahadeo told the opposition to "come here informed" and started listing healthcare achievements left, right, and centre. Telemedicine sites went from 4 in 2022 to 130 now. Medical drones being tested. Over 100 heart surgeries in 2025. On the other side, APNU's Juretha Fernandes says Indigenous communities are still being left behind despite the government spending $6 trillion since 2020. And Kaieteur is asking a very interesting question — how did 30,000 cash grant recipients just disappear between the pre-election budget and this year's budget? Before elections: $63 billion for 630,000 people. After elections: $60 billion for 600,000. Where'd the other 30,000 go?

And speaking of Parliament — you hear about the MP who fell? Coretta McDonald, she's the GTU President and APNU MP — she was walking to her seat and fell face-first. Fractured her ankle. Had to go to the hospital. Proceedings stopped completely. The budget debate is officially more dangerous than cricket at Bourda! Somebody needs to check that floor because at this rate, MPs need helmets and knee pads just to attend sessions.

In crime news, police conducted a massive cannabis eradication exercise in Linden and found eight acres of marijuana farms with 53,000 plants. Fifty-three thousand! That's not a farm, that's a national park. They burned everything — plants, dried product, camps, all of it. Street value in the millions. No arrests though. The truck driver from the Demerara bridge crash got hit with more charges — Causing Death by Dangerous Driving on top of driving without a licence, no insurance, and faulty loading. The man was doing everything wrong except maybe breathing.

Tourism is looking good though — 34,923 visitors in January, up 17.2 percent from last year. US tourists leading the pack at 38 percent, Caribbean at 29 percent. The GTA projecting 550,000 arrivals by year end which would be another record. Government also removing residency requirements for destination weddings which is smart — let people come spend money and say "I do" at the same time.

And here's the big sports news — the ICC Men's T20 World Cup kicks off TOMORROW in India and Sri Lanka! Six Guyanese players in the West Indies senior squad and two in the Under-19 team at the Youth World Cup. Plus CPL 2026 finals tickets going on general sale today. Cricket season is HERE.

One more thing from the region — Jamaica just got a US$415 million emergency loan from the IMF, Barbados has elections next Wednesday, and CARICOM gave Haiti's leadership a public rebuke. The Caribbean always has drama.

That's your Friday roundup Guyana! Have a safe and blessed weekend. Remember — read all four papers, laugh at the contradictions, and don't fall in Parliament!

See you Monday!
