[{"content":"Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting boats, and Trinidad\u0026rsquo;s PM is about to sweet-talk an energy conference. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\n🇧🇧 MIA MOTTLEY SWEEPS BARBADOS — AGAIN Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley has won every single seat in Parliament — for the third consecutive election. She is now only the second Caribbean leader in history to achieve a 30-0 sweep three times, joining former Grenada PM Dr. Keith Mitchell.\nThe Barbados Labour Party didn\u0026rsquo;t just win. They obliterated. The opposition didn\u0026rsquo;t lose seats — they lost the concept of seats. At this point the opposition benches in Barbados Parliament are decorative furniture. Mottley continues to be the most dominant political force in the Caribbean, and it\u0026rsquo;s not close.\n🚢 US MILITARY SINKS ANOTHER BOAT IN THE CARIBBEAN The US military attacked a vessel in the Caribbean Sea on February 13, killing three people. The ship was allegedly transporting drugs along known smuggling routes. This is the fourth such operation in 2026 — and we\u0026rsquo;re only six weeks into the year.\nSince September 2025, US forces have destroyed multiple vessels in international waters, killing at least 80 people. The operations are conducted under the Southern Command\u0026rsquo;s counter-narcotics mandate. No US military personnel have been injured in any of the strikes.\nThe Caribbean Sea is increasingly becoming a military theatre. Senator Peter Welch has expressed alarm at the mobilisation of National Guard troops, warships, and fighter jets to the region. For Caribbean nations caught between drug routes and US firepower, the question isn\u0026rsquo;t academic — it\u0026rsquo;s existential.\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD PM TO ADDRESS CARIBBEAN ENERGY WEEK Trinidad and Tobago\u0026rsquo;s Prime Minister will address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 as the twin-island nation positions itself at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge. T\u0026amp;T remains the region\u0026rsquo;s energy anchor, and with Guyana and Suriname\u0026rsquo;s oil booms reshaping the basin, Trinidad is working to stay relevant in a neighbourhood that suddenly got a lot richer.\n🇹🇼 TAIWAN DONATES US$3M TO ST. VINCENT Taiwan has donated US$3 million to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for social relief programmes. Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with a handful of Caribbean nations and uses strategic aid to maintain those ties. China, watching from across the strait, takes notes.\n🇻🇪 CARIBBEAN AIRSPACE STILL FEELING THE SQUEEZE The aftershocks of the US military operation in Venezuela continue to ripple through Caribbean aviation. While the initial FAA no-fly zone has expired, advisory NOTAMs remain in effect around multiple Caribbean flight regions including San Juan, Curaçao, and Piarco. Airlines have largely resumed normal operations, but routing adjustments continue to affect flight times and costs across the region.\nVenezuelan airspace itself has been effectively closed to passenger planes since late November 2025. For Caribbean travellers, the message is clear: check your flight status before you check your bags.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICAN STUDENTS IN CUBA FACE UNCERTAINTY The Jamaican government is considering what support it can provide to Jamaican students studying in Cuba, whose education is being affected by the island\u0026rsquo;s ongoing economic crisis. Cuba has historically provided scholarships to Caribbean students, particularly in medicine. But with Cuba\u0026rsquo;s economy in freefall, the question is whether those programmes can survive.\n🇧🇸 FORMER BAHAMAS POLICE OFFICER TO BE SENTENCED A former senior police officer in the Bahamas is due to be sentenced on February 25 after being found guilty on 10 counts related to the seizure of 72 kilos of cocaine and 15 kilos of marijuana. When the people catching the drugs ARE the drugs, you know things are complicated.\n🏏 T20 WORLD CUP UPDATE Zimbabwe stunned Australia with a 23-run defeat, while India steamrolled Namibia. The West Indies are preparing for the tournament, which kicked off February 7 across India and Sri Lanka. The Caribbean\u0026rsquo;s cricketers will be looking to improve on recent performances, but with the squad in rebuilding mode, expectations are tempered.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Caribbean Saturday. Mottley can\u0026rsquo;t stop winning. The US Navy can\u0026rsquo;t stop shooting. And somewhere in Barbados, an opposition politician is updating their resume.\nStay informed. Stay Caribbean.\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-14-caribbean-daily-brief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eValentine\u0026rsquo;s Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting boats, and Trinidad\u0026rsquo;s PM is about to sweet-talk an energy conference.

Love is in the air. And so is the smell of flooding, budget drama, and the slow death of print journalism. Romantic.\n📰 STABROEK NEWS IS SHUTTING DOWN The biggest news today isn\u0026rsquo;t in any newspaper. It IS a newspaper. Stabroek News will cease print publication on March 15, 2026, after nearly 40 years. Parent company Guyana Publications Inc. (GPI) is entering voluntary liquidation. Chairman Brendan de Caires blamed global digital disruption — print advertising dropped 75% worldwide since 2004, and apparently even Guyana isn\u0026rsquo;t immune to people getting their news from WhatsApp forwards and TikTok videos of people falling off things.\nMinister Kwame McCoy called it \u0026ldquo;regrettable,\u0026rdquo; which is the government equivalent of sending a \u0026ldquo;sorry for your loss\u0026rdquo; text. Kaieteur News covered it with barely concealed \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re still here\u0026rdquo; energy.\nOne down. Three to go? This Brief just got 25% harder to write.\n💸 DEMERARA BANK RAISES HOUSING LOAN CEILING TO $40M Demerara Bank has increased its residential housing loan ceiling from $30M to $40M while keeping interest rates at 5%. This is genuinely good news for homebuyers in Guyana, where the housing boom is real and the demand for mortgages is enormous.\nOf course, $40M Guyanese is roughly US$192,000 — which in Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s current property market might get you a nice two-bedroom if you squint. But progress is progress.\n🏫 BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE FOR TEACHERS The Chronicle\u0026rsquo;s editorial today backed the Ministry of Education\u0026rsquo;s decision to introduce biometric attendance systems in schools. \u0026ldquo;Accountability and Modernisation,\u0026rdquo; they called it. Teachers may call it something else.\nThe argument: you can\u0026rsquo;t have world-class education if teachers don\u0026rsquo;t show up consistently. The counter-argument: you also can\u0026rsquo;t have world-class education with overcrowded classrooms, below-market salaries, and a biometric scanner that judges you harder than any parent ever could.\nEducation Minister Sonia Parag says it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;not punishment.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;a mechanism to strengthen accountability.\u0026rdquo; That is exactly what someone says before punishing you.\n🔬 400 OF 600 MEN TEST POSITIVE FOR PROSTATE CANCER This one is serious. Health Minister Dr. Frank Anthony revealed that of approximately 600 biopsies conducted last year, roughly 400 came back positive for prostate cancer. That\u0026rsquo;s a 67% positive rate, which is staggering.\nThe minister urged men to get screened. PSA tests and biopsies are now available through the public health system. If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you do after reading this Brief today, gents — book that appointment. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a punchline.\n🏗️ GTTCI OPENS IN PORT MOURANT The Guyana Technical Training College Inc. (GTTCI) formally opens today in Port Mourant, Region Six. It\u0026rsquo;s designed to certify Guyanese workers for the oil and gas sector — particularly those who have the skills but lack the paperwork. Minister Bharrat says about 35 graduates have already gained offshore employment, many on the Unity FPSO.\nThe pitch: stop losing oil sector jobs to foreigners because Guyanese workers can\u0026rsquo;t produce a certificate. The reality: if this works, it\u0026rsquo;s genuinely transformative for Berbice. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s another ribbon-cutting in a region that\u0026rsquo;s been promised everything and delivered\u0026hellip; well, you know.\n🏀 3×3 BASKETBALL CONFIRMED FOR GLASGOW 2026 Guyana\u0026rsquo;s men\u0026rsquo;s 3×3 basketball team has been officially confirmed for the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games, July 24-29. This is only the second time 3×3 basketball features at the Commonwealth Games, and Guyana made the cut. The field has expanded from 8 to 12 teams per gender.\nNo sarcasm here. That\u0026rsquo;s a genuine achievement. Represent.\n🎓 SIR RONALD SANDERS INSTALLED AS UG CHANCELLOR Sir Ronald Sanders has officially become the 11th Chancellor of the University of Guyana. President Ali called him \u0026ldquo;a distinguished son of the soil\u0026rdquo; and set out a vision for UG to become a regional research powerhouse. Sanders is a former diplomat, Oxford visiting fellow, and holds honorary doctorates from UWI and UG itself.\nPresident Ali also stressed aligning degrees with professional designations. Because apparently a PhD is nice, but a certificate from the GTTCI is what actually gets you a job.\n📊 BUDGET DRAMA CONTINUES Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s take: The $40M allocated to the Office of the Commissioner of Information is \u0026ldquo;an insult.\u0026rdquo; Columnist GHK Lall and members of Red Thread protested outside Parliament, calling the budget \u0026ldquo;anti-poor\u0026rdquo; and questioning why Senior Counsel Charles Ramson (father of the sports minister) is getting $40M annually for an office that — according to the protestors — hasn\u0026rsquo;t produced a single useful response to information requests.\nThe Chronicle\u0026rsquo;s take: Everything is fine. The budget is transformational. Moving on.\nKaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial: \u0026ldquo;Georgetown cannot be redeemed.\u0026rdquo; A devastating column about the capital\u0026rsquo;s flooding, infrastructure decay, and the gap between development promises and gutter-level reality. Four inches of rain. Streets became canals. The official explanation: weather. The actual explanation: decades.\n🇬🇾🇧🇷 GUYANA-BRAZIL JOINT STRIKE FORCE President Ali announced that Guyana is developing a joint strike force with Brazil\u0026rsquo;s Roraima State to address transnational crime along their shared border. He also announced digital overhaul of the Police Force, e-ticketing integration with demerit systems, and baggage scanners at all airports.\nIf even half of this materialises, it would be significant. The track record on \u0026ldquo;announced at a conference\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;actually implemented\u0026rdquo; remains\u0026hellip; mixed.\n🍗 VALENTINE\u0026rsquo;S DAY SPECIAL: DEM BOYS SEH Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Dem Boys Seh\u0026rdquo; column went in on Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day restaurant prices. A \u0026ldquo;$25,000 Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Special\u0026rdquo; that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;two forkful of rice, one chicken breast cut in half like it applying fuh passport, and a slice of cake small enough fuh hide under yuh tongue.\u0026rdquo; One man decided to cook at home, light a candle, spray air freshener, and call it \u0026ldquo;five-star ambiance.\u0026rdquo; The only star his wife saw was the one spinning round her head when she tasted the salty stew.\nHappy Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day indeed. 💀\n🏭 DEL MONTE EYES PINEAPPLE INVESTMENT IN GUYANA Food production giant Del Monte is reportedly looking at a massive pineapple investment in Guyana. Details are thin, but if the international agricultural giant sets up operations here, it would be a significant boost for non-oil agriculture. The Chronicle ran the story. Everyone else was too busy arguing about budgets.\n⚓ ERREA WITTU FPSO MOORING COMPLETE Jumbo Offshore has completed mooring pre-installation for ExxonMobil\u0026rsquo;s Errea Wittu FPSO at the Uaru Field. This is ExxonMobil\u0026rsquo;s fifth production vessel offshore Guyana. The machine keeps moving. 900,000 barrels per day and climbing.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Saturday Brief. Stabroek is dying. Teachers are getting scanned. Men, go get your prostate checked. And someone please tell the Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day restaurant charging $25,000 for half a chicken that we see them.\nRead the papers so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to: Guyana Chronicle, Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, Guyana Times.\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-14-daily-brief/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHappy Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, Guyana.

And if you think this is just about one newspaper, you\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention.\n[BODY]\nSection 1: What Happened Guyana Publications Inc., the parent company of Stabroek News, is entering voluntary liquidation. Print publication ends March 15, 2026. Chairman Brendan de Caires told staff that global digital platforms — Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram — have destroyed the print advertising model. Worldwide, print ad revenue dropped from $110 billion in 2004 to $26 billion in 2024. GPI absorbed losses for years by burning through cash reserves. The reserves are gone.\nSection 2: Why It Matters Stabroek News was Guyana\u0026rsquo;s most prominent independent newspaper. Founded in 1986, it became a daily in 1994. For four decades it served as a counterweight to government-aligned media. Regardless of which party was in power, Stabroek asked the uncomfortable questions. With Stabroek gone, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s media landscape loses a critical independent voice.\nSection 3: The Bigger Picture Guyana now has three major papers: the Chronicle, which is government-owned; Kaieteur News, which is privately owned and opposition-leaning; and the Guyana Times, which is PPP-aligned. The ecosystem just lost its most centrist publication. In a country where media independence is already fragile, this is significant.\nMinister Kwame McCoy called it \u0026ldquo;regrettable\u0026rdquo; and urged media companies to evolve their strategies. Which is true — but also easy to say when the government owns a newspaper and controls state advertising.\nSection 4: What Comes Next Will Stabroek News survive as a digital-only publication? De Caires hasn\u0026rsquo;t said. The liquidation suggests a full shutdown, not a pivot. But in a country experiencing an oil-driven economic boom, there\u0026rsquo;s an argument that someone should be investing in independent journalism, not watching it die.\n[CTA] What do you think — is this a natural market correction or a loss for Guyanese democracy?

Reading the news so you can laugh, cry, and argue at the same time.\n💔 BREAKING: STABROEK NEWS IS CLOSING Source: Stabroek News\nThis is the biggest media story in Guyana in decades. Stabroek News — the country\u0026rsquo;s most respected independent newspaper — will cease printing on March 15, 2026. After 39 years.\nChairman Brendan de Caires told employees that GPI (Guyana Publications Inc.) will begin voluntary liquidation. The reason? The same thing killing newspapers worldwide — Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok ate the advertising revenue.\nThe Numbers Global print ad revenue 2004 US$110 billion Global print ad revenue 2024 US$26 billion US newspapers closed 2,000+ Canadian newspapers closed 340+ UK newspapers closed 300+ Guyana newspapers about to close 1 (and it\u0026rsquo;s the big one) Founded in 1986 by David and Doreen de Caires, Stabroek News was the paper that asked the questions nobody else would. The paper that held every government — PPP and PNC alike — accountable. The paper that Guyanese trusted when they didn\u0026rsquo;t trust anything else.\nDe Brief is genuinely sad about this one. Whatever your politics, losing an independent voice is a loss for democracy. Thirty-nine years of journalism, ending not with a scandal but with an algorithm.\nOne reader in the letters section asked if Exxon could help solve flooding and blackouts. They might want to add \u0026ldquo;saving newspapers\u0026rdquo; to that list.\n🌊 GEORGETOWN SWAMPED — AGAIN Source: All Four Papers\nFour inches of rain in four hours.

Asking for a friend.\n👮 OIL BOOM DRAINING POLICE RANKS Source: Kaieteur News\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an irony nobody predicted: Guyana\u0026rsquo;s oil wealth is actually HURTING the police force. Officers are leaving to take better-paying jobs in the oil sector. Can\u0026rsquo;t blame them — would you chase criminals for government wages when ExxonMobil is offering double?\nPresident Ali ordered a full digital overhaul of the police force at the Annual Officers\u0026rsquo; Conference, including e-ticketing integration with the demerit system, biometric systems, and a joint strike force with Brazil.\nDe Brief asks: You can digitise the police all you want, but if nobody wants to BE a police officer anymore, you\u0026rsquo;re just automating empty uniforms.\n📱 MINISTER PARAG\u0026rsquo;S DATA DUMP CONTROVERSY Source: Stabroek News (Letters), Kaieteur News\nEducation Minister Sonia Parag used biometric attendance data to publicly shame an opposition MP, Dr. Gordon Barker, in Parliament — detailing his exact teaching tardiness down to the minute.\nOne Stabroek letter called it \u0026ldquo;a calculated data dump designed to silence dissent\u0026rdquo; and warned it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the canary in the coal mine for Guyana\u0026rsquo;s digital future.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Parag says biometrics will \u0026ldquo;boost teachers\u0026rsquo; accountability, not punish them.\u0026rdquo;\nKaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial (\u0026ldquo;Parag\u0026rsquo;s Breach of Trust\u0026rdquo;) did not agree.\nDe Brief says: If the government can pull your exact attendance record and read it out in Parliament, maybe we should all be worried about what else is in that database.

This is the maiden flight of the four-booster version, and the start of 18 contracted launches for Amazon\u0026rsquo;s constellation.\nDe Brief says: Space rockets are literally launching from the Guiana coast and somehow we\u0026rsquo;re still arguing about whether the pumps are working in Georgetown. The future and the past, side by side, separated by about 400 miles.\n🏗️ BUDGET WATCH: WHERE THE MONEY GOING Source: Chronicle, Stabroek\nThe Committee of Supply continues grinding through Budget 2026 estimates:\nAllocation Amount Housing programme $150 billion GPL fuel subsidy $25.8 billion Stabroek Market + Bourda Green $2 billion Region 5 agricultural land 55,000 acres opening UG applications since free education 16,000+ New pre-med students enrolled 210 RDC/NDC stipend increases Approved Haags Bosch landfill Closing by 2029 The housing minister said nobody should live without opportunity for land ownership.

Talk about it. And read a Stabroek News article while you still can.\n4-MINUTE SCRIPT (~650 words) [TITLE CARD: GUYANA DAILY BRIEF — FRIDAY FEBRUARY 13, 2026]\nHappy Friday the 13th, Guyana. And boy, is today living up to the superstition.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the story that has the entire country talking. Stabroek News — THE Stabroek News, founded in 1986 by David and Doreen de Caires — announced today that it will cease printing on March 15th. After thirty-nine years of independent journalism, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s most respected newspaper is closing.\nChairman Brendan de Caires explained that the global collapse of print advertising made it unsustainable. Print ad revenue worldwide dropped from 110 billion dollars in 2004 to just 26 billion in 2024. More than two thousand newspapers closed in the United States alone. And now Stabroek joins that list.\nWhatever your politics — PPP, PNC, or you just want everybody to leave you alone — this is a loss. Stabroek held EVERY government accountable. Their letters page was where Guyanese democracy actually happened. And it\u0026rsquo;s going away.\nNow, the flooding. Georgetown was swamped yesterday. Four inches of rain in less than four hours. South Ruimveldt recorded nearly 97 millimetres. Lodge, Queenstown, Sophia, Campbellville, Sussex Street — all underwater.\nThe government\u0026rsquo;s response? Three ministers deployed to the field. Agriculture Minister Mustapha said drainage infrastructure held firm. Pumps activated. Sluices opened. The Chronicle backed him up.\nStabroek News had a different take: \u0026ldquo;City flooded AGAIN.\u0026rdquo; A dentist on Charlotte Street had to close their office. Businesses losing money. Regular people wading through water.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth — both sides are right. Yes, the infrastructure response was faster than it used to be. And yes, a $1.558 trillion budget should be able to prevent the capital from flooding every time it rains hard. Both things are true at the same time.\nThe Mohamed saga continues. SOCU released a second video showing what they say is illegal cambio activity happening at the Lombard Street enterprise — just minutes before the raid. The Bank of Guyana revoked the licence. Operating without a licence is a criminal offence. And the first video from Wednesday already showed currency exchange activity.\nMohamed\u0026rsquo;s response was predictable — he linked it to his Parliament speech about bankrolling the PPP. The Chronicle editorial wasn\u0026rsquo;t having it, pointing out that the US indictment covers 2017 to 2024, years before Mohamed entered politics.\nOver in Barbados, Mia Mottley was sworn in for her third consecutive term as Prime Minister. The BLP swept all thirty seats. Again. For the third time in a row. She\u0026rsquo;s now only the second Caribbean leader to achieve that particular hat trick.\nIn budget news, the Committee of Supply keeps rolling. Housing Minister Croal announced $150 billion for housing in 2026. Education Minister Parag said UG applications jumped to 16,000 since free education launched. The Haags Bosch landfill is being phased out by 2029. And $2 billion is earmarked for Stabroek Market and Bourda Green rehabilitation.\nBut Parag is also in hot water — she used biometric attendance data to publicly shame an opposition MP\u0026rsquo;s teaching record in Parliament. A Stabroek News letter writer called it \u0026ldquo;a calculated data dump designed to silence dissent.\u0026rdquo; Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial called it a \u0026ldquo;breach of trust.\u0026rdquo; That data privacy debate isn\u0026rsquo;t going away.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s something cool though — the Ariane 64 heavy rocket launched from French Guiana carrying 32 Amazon satellites. First flight of the four-booster version. Eighteen more launches are contracted. Space rockets are literally launching from the Guiana coast while we argue about drainage pumps.\nAnd Kaieteur News reports the oil boom is draining police ranks. Officers leaving for better-paying jobs in the oil sector. You can digitise the force all you want, but if nobody wants the job, the uniforms stay empty.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Friday Brief. Read Stabroek News while you still can. Share this with somebody who cares about Guyana.

The Committee of Supply phase is where line-by-line examination occurs, producing the detailed spending revelations that the debate phase typically lacks.\nInfrastructure: Berbice Bridge Acquisition Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill confirmed the government is finalising the process for full acquisition of the Berbice Bridge. The bridge, currently operating under a public-private partnership model, has been a source of public frustration over toll increases. Full government ownership would give the state direct control over toll policy and maintenance.\nGold Sector: Mercury Reduction \u0026amp; Branding Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat announced plans to reduce mercury use in gold mining, brand Guyana\u0026rsquo;s gold for international markets, and support small miners in 2026. The initiatives come as the gold and bauxite mining sub-sectors are projected to expand by 5.4% and 19.3% respectively this year.\nThe announcements gain additional significance in the context of the Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise allegations — the OFAC sanctions specifically cited gold export fraud and tax evasion.

Health authorities are urging standard prevention measures: eliminating standing water, using repellent, and wearing protective clothing.\nInvestment: GO-Invest Reports $157B In New Projects The Guyana Office for Investment facilitated GY$157 billion in new projects in 2025.

Stay informed, Guyana.\n[END — 60 SECONDS]\n4-Minute Script: \u0026ldquo;The SOCU Raid, The Bankrolling Claims, And What It All Means\u0026rdquo; [AVATAR ON SCREEN]\nGood morning. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the biggest story in Guyana today.\nYesterday, more than twenty officers from the Special Organised Crime Unit descended on Lombard Street in Georgetown. Their target: Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise, the cambio and gold trading business owned by the family of Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what makes this complicated. Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise has been closed since 2024, when the US Treasury sanctioned the Mohamed family under the Global Magnitsky Act for alleged corruption and gold smuggling. A federal grand jury in Miami has indicted both Azruddin and his father Nazar on eleven counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and customs violations. They\u0026rsquo;re currently in extradition proceedings.\n[BEAT]\nSo why raid a closed building? SOCU says they received credible intelligence about illegal financial activities. Mohamed says the raid is retaliation for what he said in Parliament last Friday — that he bankrolled the PPP with hundreds of millions of dollars, and that the money is sitting at Freedom House.\nHe told the search party, quote: \u0026ldquo;All the money I give PPP deh at Freedom House. Go there and search.\u0026rdquo;\nThe PPP has said\u0026hellip; nothing. Vice President Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s phone went to voicemail. President Ali\u0026rsquo;s phone went to voicemail. Freedom House is silent.\n[BEAT]\nNow here\u0026rsquo;s the second story that got buried under all the SOCU drama. During budget estimates on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Hugh Todd confirmed that the government pays two American lobby firms a combined US$90,000 per month. That\u0026rsquo;s over a million US dollars a year for \u0026ldquo;advocacy services.\u0026rdquo;\nOne firm gets fifty thousand a month. Another gets four thousand. WIN parliamentarian Tabitha Sarabo-Haley asked whether the firms had anything to do with extradition matters. Todd said no — they highlight national development initiatives.\nA million dollars a year to tell Washington how well Guyana is doing. Make of that what you will.\n[BEAT]\nIn other news: GuySuCo says it\u0026rsquo;s on track for profitability by 2030. The government is finalising acquisition of the Berbice Bridge. Thirty students were caught skipping school in a city sweep. And a nineteen-year-old was arrested for the fatal stabbing of a tourist guide.\nRegionally, Barbados went to the polls yesterday with Mia Mottley\u0026rsquo;s BLP expected to sweep all thirty seats. Cuba told airlines they can no longer refuel on the island — that\u0026rsquo;s how bad the fuel crisis has gotten. And Trinidad is positioning itself as the \u0026ldquo;gold standard\u0026rdquo; for energy sector business ahead of the Guyana Energy Conference next week.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Daily Brief for Thursday, February twelfth, twenty twenty-six.

Leh me understand this properly.\nA man who is sanctioned by the United States Treasury. A man who is indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on 11 counts. A man whose family is accused of evading US$50 million in gold export taxes. A man who is literally facing extradition proceedings in Georgetown court right now.\nAnd when SOCU searches his premises based on credible intelligence\u0026hellip; that is political victimisation?\nFacts Are Facts The US Department of Treasury sanctioned Azruddin Mohamed, Nazar Mohamed, and Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise in June 2024 under the Global Magnitsky Act. This is not the PPP doing this. This is the United States government saying these people engaged in corruption, bribery, and tax evasion.\nThe 25-page federal indictment alleges Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise omitted more than 10,000 kilograms of gold from import and export declarations. That is TEN THOUSAND KILOGRAMS. And avoided paying more than $50 million in duty taxes.\nSo when SOCU gets intelligence that illegal financial activities may be taking place at a premises connected to these individuals, what exactly should they do? Send a polite letter?\nThe Bankrolling Claims Now, regarding this business about bankrolling the PPP. If Mohamed gave hundreds of millions to the PPP, that is between Mohamed and the PPP. Political donations are a normal part of democracy everywhere in the world.\nBut here is what Mohamed is NOT telling you: wealthy businessmen fund political parties because they expect favourable treatment in return. The OFAC sanctions document specifically states that Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise \u0026ldquo;engaged in extensive bribery schemes involving government officials.\u0026rdquo;\nSo which is it? Did he fund the PPP out of patriotism? Or was he buying protection for his gold smuggling operation? The US government has already answered that question.\nThe Lobby Firms As for the US$90,000 per month for lobby firms — every developing country with significant foreign policy interests retains advocacy firms in Washington and other capitals. This is standard international practice. Minister Todd explained this clearly. Trinidad does it. Jamaica does it. Even tiny island states do it.\nGuyana has a border dispute heading to the ICJ, a booming oil sector requiring international engagement, and complex diplomatic relationships to manage. Spending US$1 million a year on professional advocacy is not extravagance — it is basic governance.\nThe Bottom Line SOCU did its job. The lobby firms are standard practice. And a US-sanctioned, US-indicted businessman claiming political victimisation because law enforcement searched his premises is like a man caught with his hand in the cookie jar saying the jar attacked him.\nThe facts don\u0026rsquo;t lie, even when politicians do.\nUncle Ramesh provides the government perspective on national affairs.

Twenty armed officers could not find twenty million dollars.

Minister Edghill confirmed the details during budget estimates. After years of the private-public partnership model producing toll increases and public frustration, Georgetown wants full control. Whether government ownership means lower tolls or just different people collecting the same tolls remains to be seen.\nChikungunya Cases Rising Across The Americas Health authorities warn that chikungunya cases are increasing across the Caribbean and the Americas. As if we didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough things to worry about between SOCU raids and lobby firm bills.\nThe Guyana Daily Brief is satire.

You see?! ONE POINT UP! That is PROGRESS!\nYou know how hard it is to move up even ONE point on these international rankings? You think Denmark woke up one morning at 90 points? NO! They built it BRICK BY BRICK! Just like the PPP building Guyana!\nAnd let me tell you something about this Transparency International people. They sitting in Berlin, air conditioning blasting, telling Caribbean countries they corrupt. You know what I call that? IRONIC. Half of Europe colonised US and STOLE our resources and NOW they grading us on honesty?\nBut the PPP STILL improved! Under APNU we went DOWN. Under PPP we going UP. The math is simple, beta.\nAnd this \u0026ldquo;intimidation of media\u0026rdquo; nonsense — Kaieteur News publishes whatever they want EVERY SINGLE DAY. You call that intimidation? In some countries, editors disappear. Here, editors get their own columns to curse the government! That is FREEDOM!\nOn the 30 Blacklisted Contractors THIS! THIS IS ACCOUNTABILITY!\nThe Brief trying to make this sound bad. Thirty contractors BLACKLISTED! You know what that means? It means the government is HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE!\nUnder APNU, contractors did sloppy work and got MORE contracts. Under PPP? You mess up, you get CUT. That is how a REAL government operates.\nAnd this Belle Vue pump station story — yes, it\u0026rsquo;s at 29%. You know why? Because the CONTRACTOR failed, not the GOVERNMENT. The government is PUNISHING bad contractors! That\u0026rsquo;s LITERALLY what the blacklist is for!\nBut no, Kaieteur wants to focus on WHO got the contract instead of celebrating that the government is actually FIXING the problem. Classic Kaieteur. The house is on fire and they complaining about the colour of the fire truck.\nOn Gas-to-Energy The President personally toured Brazil\u0026rsquo;s gas plant! He studying SUCCESSFUL MODELS! He meeting with FOREIGN LEADERS! He getting Brazil\u0026rsquo;s HIGHEST HONOUR!\nAnd what the Brief does? \u0026ldquo;Five years in and we\u0026rsquo;re still at 68%.\u0026rdquo;\nBeta. Building a 300-megawatt power plant is not like building a chicken coop. Sixty-eight percent in five years for a project this size? That is EXCELLENT. Go check how long it took Trinidad to build their gas infrastructure. Go check. I\u0026rsquo;ll wait.\nAnd when this thing done — FIFTY PERCENT reduction in electricity bills. FIFTY. Every household in Guyana saving money. Every business saving money. But Kaieteur will find something to complain about. \u0026ldquo;The light too bright!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The electricity too cheap!\u0026rdquo; Always something.\nOn Sugar You people does laugh at sugar. But let me tell you something — sugar is HERITAGE. Sugar is CULTURE. Sugar is the backbone of communities from Berbice to Demerara.\nWhen APNU shut down those estates, they didn\u0026rsquo;t just close factories. They destroyed FAMILIES. Seven thousand people on the breadline! Children going hungry! And now the PPP investing $13.4 BILLION to bring it back, and you want to make jokes?\nOne hundred thousand tonnes target. Mechanisation. Factory upgrades. This is a PLAN. Not like APNU\u0026rsquo;s plan which was \u0026ldquo;close everything and hope for the best.\u0026rdquo;\nYou watch. By 2030, GuySuCo going be profitable. And when it happen, I want all the critics to line up and apologise. Starting with Kaieteur News editor.\nOn the Guyana Flag at the Super Bowl I NEARLY FALL OFF MY COUCH IN QUEENS!\nYou know how many Guyanese living in America? HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! And you telling me we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be represented at the biggest event in American sports?\nThis letter writer in Stabroek saying we \u0026ldquo;haven\u0026rsquo;t contributed to American football\u0026rdquo; — beta, Guyanese Americans CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA EVERY SINGLE DAY. We pay taxes. We build businesses. We raise families. We BUY Super Bowl tickets!\nBad Bunny showed the Caribbean flag and suddenly people vex? The WHOLE WORLD saw our Golden Arrowhead! Do you know how much that kind of exposure COSTS if you have to pay for it? MILLIONS! And we got it FREE!\nMy WhatsApp group in Queens exploded. Everybody recording the TV. Everybody sending screenshots. PRIDE, beta. That is what representation looks like.\nThe only people upset are the same people who upset about everything.\nOn Venezuela Now THIS the Brief got right. Venezuela telling America to leave. And I am not surprised.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t just remove a country\u0026rsquo;s president and then expect the people to be grateful. That is not how sovereignty works. But you know what? At least Guyana SMART. We working WITH the Americans on oil. We working WITH Brazil on borders. We playing chess while Venezuela playing checkers.\nPresident Ali meeting with Roraima Governor about joint border patrols? GENIUS. That is called PROACTIVE leadership. Not waiting for a crisis — PREVENTING one.\nAnd you notice — the Chronicle reported on it. The Brief reported on it. Even Kaieteur had to acknowledge it. Because when the PPP does something undeniably smart, even the critics have to admit it.\nWhat the Brief MISSED (As Usual) The Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t mention:\n$157 BILLION in non-oil investments in 2025! That is DIVERSIFICATION, beta. While everybody talking about oil oil oil, the PPP quietly building an economy that doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on one thing. Agriculture, manufacturing, services — REAL economic development.\nThe Amerindian hostel — $500 million for indigenous peoples travelling to Georgetown for medical care. You know how many governments ignore indigenous communities? But the PPP BUILDING them a two-storey facility. That is COMPASSION in action.\nThe Bayroc National Stadium — Linden now has a world-class facility. And who built it? The PPP government. For a town that votes APNU. THAT is what governing for ALL looks like.\nUntil tomorrow, beta. Try to read the Chronicle once in a while. It won\u0026rsquo;t hurt you.\n— Uncle Ramesh, Queens, NY 🇬🇾\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-11-uncle-ramesh/","summary":"Uncle Ramesh from Queens celebrates the corruption index improvement, explains why 30 blacklisted contractors proves the government is WORKING, and has strong opinions about the Guyana flag at the Super Bowl.","title":"Uncle Ramesh Responds: 'ONE Point?

Welcome to Wednesday, February 11, 2026 — where we moved up ONE POINT on the global corruption index and the government is celebrating like we won the World Cup, 30 contractors just got blacklisted for being bad at their jobs, and our flag showed up at the NFL Super Bowl halftime show and NOBODY CAN AGREE if that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\nMeanwhile, the Opposition Leader\u0026rsquo;s company is getting raided by police, cattle thieves in Berbice have developed STRATEGIES, and Venezuela is telling America to go home.\nHappy Hump Day! ☕\n📊 TODAY\u0026rsquo;S NUMBERS Stat What It Means 40/100 Guyana\u0026rsquo;s corruption score (up from 39).

Kaieteur News led with this today and they are NOT impressed.\nTransparency International\u0026rsquo;s 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index has Guyana at a score of 40 out of 100, up from 39. We\u0026rsquo;re now ranked 84th out of 184 countries.\nFor context: 100 means squeaky clean. 0 means\u0026hellip; well, you know.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the part the Chronicle probably won\u0026rsquo;t highlight: the same report flagged Guyana for intimidation of independent media and civil society. The watchdog group says this is \u0026ldquo;weakening oversight and accountability.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Chronicle\u0026rsquo;s spin? \u0026ldquo;Guyana has significantly improved!\u0026rdquo;\nKaieteur\u0026rsquo;s spin? \u0026ldquo;Guyana still ranked among corrupt nations!\u0026rdquo;\nBoth are technically correct. Which is the most frustrating kind of correct.\nSources: Kaieteur News, Guyana Chronicle\n🚜 30 Contractors BLACKLISTED — Including One Interesting Story Agriculture Minister Mustapha told the Committee of Supply that his ministry has formally flagged 30 contractors as delinquent and sent their names to the National Procurement Board.\nTranslation: You did bad work, you\u0026rsquo;re not getting more contracts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the gem buried in Stabroek News: the controversial Belle Vue pump station is only 29% complete after being awarded to — wait for it — a social media influencer friend of the government who had never done this type of work before.\nTwenty-nine percent.\nFor comparison, the Meten-Meer-Zorg pump station? 83% complete. Almost like experienced contractors build things faster. Who knew?\nAnd in a separate but related story, Kaieteur ran a headline: \u0026ldquo;Critic\u0026rsquo;s company blacklisted\u0026rdquo; — suggesting that if you criticize the government, your company might end up on a different kind of list.\nSources: Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, Guyana Chronicle\n⛽ Gas-to-Energy: 68% Done, Ali Tours Brazil\u0026rsquo;s Version Two gas stories today:\nStory 1: Prime Minister Phillips told Parliament the Gas-to-Energy project at Wales is now 68% done. The budget approved another $10.7 billion for 2026. When completed, electricity prices should drop from $0.22 to $0.11 per kilowatt-hour. That\u0026rsquo;s a 50% reduction.\nStory 2: President Ali visited Brazil\u0026rsquo;s Jaguatirica II gas plant in Roraima — a 141-megawatt facility that powers about 70-80% of that state\u0026rsquo;s electricity. He got a tour and Brazil\u0026rsquo;s highest honour for strengthening economic ties.\nThe optimist says: \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s studying successful models!\u0026rdquo;\nThe pessimist says: \u0026ldquo;Five years in and we\u0026rsquo;re still at 68%?\u0026rdquo;\nThe realist says: \u0026ldquo;At least it\u0026rsquo;s not 29% like that pump station.\u0026rdquo;\nSources: Kaieteur News, Guyana Chronicle\n🍬 Sugar: The Five-Year Plan That Always Takes Five More Years Minister Mustapha defended GuySuCo\u0026rsquo;s strategic plan, promising the sugar industry will return to profitability by 2030.\nThe 2026 budget gives sugar $13.4 billion. GuySuCo is targeting 100,000 tonnes of production this year. The plan involves \u0026ldquo;aggressive mechanisation and factory recapitalisation.\u0026rdquo;\nQuick reminder: the APNU+AFC government shut down several estates and put 7,000+ workers on the breadline between 2015-2018.\nQuicker reminder: sugar has been \u0026ldquo;on the path back to profitability\u0026rdquo; for approximately forever.\nNobody is holding their breath. But the $13.4 billion is real.\nSources: Guyana Chronicle, Guyana Standard\n🏈 The Flag Fight: Guyana at the Super Bowl Halftime Show This one is genuinely entertaining.\nStabroek News Letters section is ON FIRE because Bad Bunny\u0026rsquo;s Super Bowl halftime show featured multiple national flags — including Guyana\u0026rsquo;s.\nOne letter writer is FURIOUS: Guyana has not contributed to American football and should not have been mentioned during the halftime show, they wrote, adding that they never see the American flag at cricket events.\nThey have a point. They also sound like they need a nap.\nMeanwhile, other Guyanese are thrilled their flag was on the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest stage. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of argument that can only happen in the Caribbean: angry about free international exposure.\nSource: Stabroek News\n🌎 Venezuela vs. America — Round 2 Kaieteur News ran a fascinating analysis: Venezuela\u0026rsquo;s interim President Delcy Rodrigues is telling Washington to back off. The Americans removed Maduro but now Venezuelans want the Americans OUT.\nThe paper drew a pointed parallel: what Venezuela is experiencing now with American interference, Guyana has lived with since 2016 in the oil sector. That\u0026rsquo;s a spicy take whether you agree or not.\nMeanwhile, Guyana approached Brazil\u0026rsquo;s Roraima State about joint border patrols.

Same cane field. Different price tag.\nMeanwhile, Stabroek asked the PM about debts owed to their newspaper.

Between de Super Bowl flag drama, pump station confusion, and contractor blacklist, me phone ain\u0026rsquo;t stop ringing since Monday. Lemme tell you wha me hear\u0026hellip;\n🏈 Somebody PAID for Dat Flag! Now, you know me hear dat de Guyana flag at de Super Bowl halftime show wasn\u0026rsquo;t no accident. A certain well-connected businessman from Richmond Hill, Queens — who shall remain nameless because me ain\u0026rsquo;t trying to get sue — allegedly reached out to Bad Bunny\u0026rsquo;s production team and PAID for de Golden Arrowhead to be included.\nHow much? Chile, de rumor say anywhere from US$50,000 to \u0026ldquo;a couple drinks and a promise.\u0026rdquo; Knowing how Caribbean people negotiate, me believe de drinks version.\nBut HERE is de funny part — de same man who allegedly arranged it is now DENYING it because certain people in Guyana are UPSET about it.

Still at de same percentage it was last month. But de Instagram page? THRIVING. Getting sponsorship deals from a paint company. A PAINT COMPANY.

Grab your coffee, this one\u0026rsquo;s spicy.\n🏅 Ali Gets Medal, Country Gets More Promises President Ali popped across to Boa Vista on Monday and came back wearing the Medalha Forte São Joaquim — Roraima\u0026rsquo;s highest honour — presented by Governor Antonio Denarium. The Chronicle gave it the full red-carpet treatment, naturally.\nAli talked about \u0026ldquo;removing barriers to trade, improving connectivity, and creating an enabling environment for private-sector engagement\u0026rdquo; with Brazil. You know, all the things we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about since approximately 1966.\nTo be fair, the Guyana-Roraima corridor has genuine economic potential — food security, energy collaboration, transport linkages. But if you\u0026rsquo;ve driven the road to Lethem recently, you know \u0026ldquo;improved transport linkages\u0026rdquo; is doing some heavy lifting as a phrase.\nSCORECARD: 🏅 Medal received: 1 | 🛣️ Roads to Lethem actually fixed: TBD\n🏛️ Committee of Supply: Where Numbers Go to Be Interrogated The National Assembly turned itself into the Committee of Supply on Monday, and the estimates got a proper working-over. Here\u0026rsquo;s your cheat sheet:\nAllocation Amount The Catch Commissioner of Information $40M Hasn\u0026rsquo;t produced an annual report in over a decade. Charles Ramson Snr reportedly gives \u0026ldquo;derisive responses\u0026rdquo; to public requests. Forty million dollars for a man who apparently treats accountability like an optional hobby. Opposition Leader\u0026rsquo;s Office $34M Approved, though Opposition Leader Mohamed says he STILL hasn\u0026rsquo;t received a vehicle or security, weeks after his election. Apparently \u0026ldquo;transition\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;wait.\u0026rdquo; Police Promotions 645 officers Under consideration, but the Police Service Commission itself has two vacancies after two members died. Who promotes the promoters? PYAC (Youth Council) $75M Virtual academic lessons, healthy living campaigns, and a \u0026ldquo;national youth cloud database.\u0026rdquo; Because what 22-year-olds really want is another government database. Lands \u0026amp; Surveys $119M New housing and agricultural lands from June. Minister Teixeira says it\u0026rsquo;s coming. Lindeners: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve heard this one before.\u0026rdquo; Teaching Service — 2,800 vacancies for senior teachers. Two thousand eight hundred. Let that marinate. 📋 GECOM Says: Check Yuh Name The Revised List of Electors is now published for 21 days of public scrutiny, effective February 7. This is for the upcoming Local Government Elections, and GECOM is practically begging people to verify their registration.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing — GECOM itself has vacancies for the Deputy Chief Elections Officer, Assistant CEO, Legal Officer, IT Manager, Research Officer, and Chief Accountant. That\u0026rsquo;s not a staffing problem. That\u0026rsquo;s a skeleton crew running an election.\nMoney has been set aside in the $6.9 billion GECOM allocation for LGE. But as Demerara Waves noted, GECOM \u0026ldquo;has not met in recent times\u0026rdquo; due to questions about whether three commissioners still properly represent the new opposition landscape.\nTranslation: We have money for an election, a voters list for an election, and no functioning commission to run the election. Peak Guyana.\n🔥 Kaieteur Says PPP \u0026ldquo;Lost\u0026rdquo; the Budget Debate The Kaieteur editorial didn\u0026rsquo;t hold back. For five years, they write, the PPP\u0026rsquo;s parliamentary strategy was to endlessly rehearse APNU+AFC\u0026rsquo;s failures from 2015-2020. It worked because APNU couldn\u0026rsquo;t defend their own record coherently.\nBut now? The PPP has its OWN record — \u0026ldquo;visible and unavoidable.\u0026rdquo; The old playbook of going after the previous government \u0026ldquo;landed with diminishing force, like blows delivered long after the opponent has moved on.\u0026rdquo;\nThe paper says PPP MPs were \u0026ldquo;crass, ill-mannered, shallow, condescending, and at times outright disgraceful\u0026rdquo; during budget debates. And they argue WIN Leader Mohamed surprised everyone by delivering a coherent presentation. \u0026ldquo;They said he couldn\u0026rsquo;t talk. He spoke.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Chronicle, meanwhile, ran editorials about opposition politicians grabbing \u0026ldquo;poverty statistics as a drowning person grabs for driftwood.\u0026rdquo; So the duelling narratives are fully engaged.\n🕵️ Extradition Saga: Now With a Mystery Second Request Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s extradition hearing was postponed Monday — he\u0026rsquo;s reportedly unwell. But the real bombshell: a Permanent Secretary admitted in court that a SECOND extradition request from the US was received on November 25, 2025.\nMinister Hugh Todd publicly denied receiving another request. The Permanent Secretary, under cross-examination, said otherwise. Someone\u0026rsquo;s story doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a small discrepancy.\nNo one knows who the second request is for. The government isn\u0026rsquo;t saying. The opposition isn\u0026rsquo;t saying. The court isn\u0026rsquo;t saying. Classic Guyana: everyone knows something, nobody\u0026rsquo;s talking.\n🔐 Data Protection: 30 Months Late, But Who\u0026rsquo;s Counting? Stabroek\u0026rsquo;s editorial took the government to task for finally appointing a Data Protection Commissioner — roughly 30 months after passing the Data Protection Act. The paper called it \u0026ldquo;another telling example of how PPP/C governments have toyed with important pieces of legislation.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then Stabroek dropped the real bomb: people who gave their contact information for the $100,000 cash grant were later contacted by PPP operatives asking for their vote before the September 2025 elections.\nIf your grant application data was used for campaign calls, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly the kind of breach a Data Protection Commissioner should investigate. Assuming the Commissioner actually starts working before the next election.\n🏥 Brand New Hospital Already Flooding WIN MP Sarabo-Halley used her budget debate presentation to highlight that a $6.6 billion, 75-bed regional hospital commissioned just six months ago is already experiencing flooding. No forensic engineering assessment has been released. No one has been held accountable.\nShe also delivered the line of the week: \u0026ldquo;Too many Guyanese believe that political affiliation determines opportunity.\u0026rdquo;\n⚡ Quick Hits Kato Hydro Plant operational — 24 buildings now powered in the indigenous community, 17 residents employed including 5 women trained in plant operations.

Schools will be closed on election day to serve as polling stations.\nMottley slammed DLP candidate Ralph Thorne for an interview with Trinidad media, suggesting external interference. Meanwhile, DLP\u0026rsquo;s Jason Phillips in St. Peter has promised new roads, water systems, expanded healthcare and housing reform.\nThe BLP won 30 of 30 seats in 2022. The question isn\u0026rsquo;t whether Mottley wins — it\u0026rsquo;s whether the DLP can actually win seats this time.\nKey stories:\nEarly voting is already underway Dr. Browne highlights her record in St. Philip North Funds approved for St. Philip West Polyclinic redevelopment \u0026ldquo;Breadfruit as a national superfood\u0026rdquo; — Mottley\u0026rsquo;s latest agricultural initiative 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: PM Addresses Caribbean Energy Week PM Kamla Persad Bissessar will address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid what organizers are calling a \u0026ldquo;multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge.\u0026rdquo; Trinidad remains the Caribbean\u0026rsquo;s energy powerhouse, and with US military presence increasing in the Caribbean Sea, the geopolitics of energy in the region have never been more complex.\nDefence Minister Wayne Sturge has had to dismiss social media claims that Trinidad\u0026rsquo;s airspace has been restricted. \u0026ldquo;All aviation operations remain normal,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nMeanwhile, the US has reaffirmed its \u0026ldquo;strong partnership\u0026rdquo; with Persad Bissessar\u0026rsquo;s government, even as tensions rise over US military strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean.

It\u0026rsquo;s Monday, February 9, 2026. The T20 World Cup is in full swing, the Budget debate just wrapped with more fireworks than Diwali, and Christopher Ram is asking questions that nobody in government wants to answer. Grab your coffee. This one\u0026rsquo;s spicy.\n1. 🔍 Auditor General Goes Blank While Spending Explodes Christopher Ram — chartered accountant, attorney, and the man the government wishes would take up gardening — published a devastating column this weekend. His target? Auditor General Deodat Sharma, who has reportedly applied for a two-year extension of his tenure.\nRam\u0026rsquo;s summary of the situation is brutal: the AG\u0026rsquo;s original appointment was \u0026ldquo;accidental\u0026rdquo; (an AFC member was absent from the Public Accounts Committee the day of confirmation), public spending has exploded into the trillions, and yet the audit reports are\u0026hellip; nowhere.\n\u0026ldquo;The framework is structurally incapable of producing independence,\u0026rdquo; Ram wrote.\nTranslation: the person who\u0026rsquo;s supposed to check the government\u0026rsquo;s receipts is asking the government for a contract extension. Nothing to see here, folks.\nWhat Ram Said What It Means AG appointment was \u0026ldquo;accidental\u0026rdquo; Nobody planned this AG asking President for extension Independence? What independence? Billions remain unaudited The receipts are missing AG has \u0026ldquo;gone blank\u0026rdquo; Silence is golden (for some) Scorecard: 🔴 Opposition will weaponize this. 🟢 Government will say Ram is biased. 🤷 The money remains unaccounted for regardless.\n2. 🚢 77 Cubans Screened for Suspected Human Trafficking In news that sounds like it belongs in a Netflix documentary, 77 Cuban nationals have been screened in connection with suspected human trafficking operations. Details are still emerging, but the sheer number is alarming.\nCuba is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis — the US has branded the island an \u0026ldquo;extraordinary threat,\u0026rdquo; Venezuelan oil shipments have stopped since the Maduro removal, and Cubans are desperate enough to take increasingly dangerous routes out.\nThis story has layers: immigration enforcement, regional migration pressure, and the question of whether Guyana is becoming a transit point. We\u0026rsquo;ll be watching.\n3. 🏠 More Than 20 Homes Bulldozed in Circuitville If you lived in Circuitville and went to work this morning with a house, congratulations — you\u0026rsquo;re one of the lucky ones. More than 20 homes were bulldozed in what appears to be a government land reclamation exercise.\nThe details are thin, the emotions are high, and the affected families are asking the question everyone asks: \u0026ldquo;Where do we go now?\u0026rdquo;\nHousing Minister Croal has been busy lately warning about \u0026ldquo;hasty resales\u0026rdquo; of government-allocated houses. Whether this is connected remains unclear, but the optics of bulldozing people\u0026rsquo;s homes while championing a $1.588 trillion \u0026ldquo;people first\u0026rdquo; budget are\u0026hellip; challenging.\n4. 📖 The Great Reading Debate: Should MPs Be Allowed to Read Speeches? Here\u0026rsquo;s a controversy that only Parliament could produce. During his maiden Budget speech, Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed was repeatedly interrupted by PPP/C MPs who accused him of — brace yourselves — reading his speech.\nYes. The governing party\u0026rsquo;s main objection to the Opposition Leader\u0026rsquo;s first-ever Budget address was that he was using a written text. Standing Orders technically prohibit reading speeches verbatim but allow \u0026ldquo;notes and quotations.\u0026rdquo;\nKaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial called it an \u0026ldquo;archaic rule\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;belongs to another era.\u0026rdquo; The Chronicle\u0026rsquo;s columnist called Mohamed a \u0026ldquo;slave to his carefully written and vetted script\u0026rdquo; and suggested his sister wrote it.\nPaper Verdict on Mohamed Kaieteur Rule is outdated, let the man read Chronicle Worst opposition leader ever, couldn\u0026rsquo;t debate without a script Stabroek Procedural wrangle distracted from actual budget substance The real question nobody\u0026rsquo;s asking: If the minister who recited a teacher\u0026rsquo;s punctuality record had THAT memorized\u0026hellip; what else do they have memorized?\n5. 🏟️ Bayroc Stadium Opens in Linden — Ali Takes Centre Stage President Ali showed up in Linden on Saturday evening for the grand opening of the Bayroc National Stadium, Linden\u0026rsquo;s first-ever national-standard sporting facility. The President reportedly \u0026ldquo;took centre stage\u0026rdquo; — a phrase that does a lot of heavy lifting.\nThis is objectively good news for Linden, a community that has long felt neglected by the PPP/C government. A proper stadium means hosting national events, economic activity, and proof that budget allocations sometimes turn into actual buildings.\nComing alongside the Palmyra International Stadium and McKenzie multipurpose facility, the government\u0026rsquo;s sports infrastructure push is real. Whether the maintenance budgets will match the construction budgets is the question for 2027.\n6. ⚡ $10.7 Billion for Gas-to-Energy — The Project That Won\u0026rsquo;t Die The 2026 Budget includes $10.7 billion for the Gas-to-Energy project at Wales. That\u0026rsquo;s $8.1 billion from US EXIM Bank loans and $2.6 billion from the national treasury.\nRunning total so far: $258 billion spent. Original promise: electricity costs cut by 50%. Original deadline: long passed. Current deadline: \u0026ldquo;end of 2026.\u0026rdquo;\nPrime Minister Phillips told Parliament the project has \u0026ldquo;moved decisively into large-scale execution\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;remains on track.\u0026rdquo; Kaieteur noted that the project has missed \u0026ldquo;several deadlines.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth statements can be true. That\u0026rsquo;s what makes this story so perfectly Guyanese.\n7. 🎓 Law School Construction Starts This Year Attorney General Nandlall announced that construction of the fourth Council of Legal Education law school will begin in 2026, right on the UG campus. Eight acres of land have been cleared.\n\u0026ldquo;During the year 2026 we will begin the construction of a law school in Guyana,\u0026rdquo; Nandlall said, which is the kind of sentence that means either \u0026ldquo;groundbreaking in March\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll throw some cement at it in December.\u0026rdquo;\nThe school is supposed to attract students from across the Caribbean and provide affordable legal education. Given that Guyana currently produces lawyers at approximately the same rate it produces astronauts, this is welcome.\n8. 🚁 Drone Operators Warned: Comply or Face the Law The Guyana Civil Aviation Authority issued a stern warning to drone operators after Minister of Amerindian Affairs Sarah Browne complained about a drone flying over her home.\nLet me repeat that. A government minister had to ask for security because someone was flying a drone over her house. The GCAA reminded everyone that drone regulations are \u0026ldquo;not optional but mandatory.\u0026rdquo;\nSomewhere in Georgetown, a 16-year-old with a DJI Mini is sweating.\n9. 🏫 World Bank Funding Dropout Prevention The Education Ministry is using World Bank financing to develop a National Standard Operating Procedure for secondary school dropout prevention, including an Early Warning System and a Reintegration Framework.\nThis is boring-sounding but genuinely important. Guyana has a dropout problem. An early warning system that flags at-risk students before they disappear from the system could save thousands of futures.\nThe fact that it\u0026rsquo;s World Bank-funded means external oversight, measurable targets, and the kind of accountability that the Auditor General apparently can\u0026rsquo;t provide locally. (Sorry. Too soon?)\n10. 🏏 CRICKET! Hetmyer Smashes Fastest WI T20 World Cup Fifty The T20 World Cup kicked off and Guyana\u0026rsquo;s own Shimron Hetmyer immediately made headlines, smashing the fastest fifty by a West Indian in T20 World Cup history — off just 22 balls — breaking Chris Gayle\u0026rsquo;s record from 2009.\nHetmyer\u0026rsquo;s 64 off 36 balls (6 sixes, 2 fours) rescued the Windies from a sluggish start against Scotland at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Then Romario Shepherd — also Guyanese — took 5 wickets for 20 runs, including a hat-trick and four wickets in five balls.\nWest Indies won by 35 runs. Two Guyanese stars. One unforgettable night.\nPlayer Performance Record Hetmyer 64 off 36 balls Fastest WI T20 WC fifty (22 balls) Shepherd 5/20 Second T20I hat-trick in 4 months WI total 182/5 Scotland all out 147 Next up: West Indies vs England, February 11.

He is not affiliated with any political party, but he does believe in giving credit where credit is due.\n🏏 TWO GUYANESE BOYS JUST OWNED THE T20 WORLD CUP Let me start where the Brief should have started — with PRIDE.\nShimron Hetmyer, born in Cumberland, Mahaica-Berbice, just broke Chris Gayle\u0026rsquo;s record for the fastest West Indies fifty in T20 World Cup history. TWENTY-TWO BALLS. Six sixes. The man arrived in India hours before the match because of visa issues, and he STILL destroyed Scotland.\nThen Romario Shepherd, from Lethem — LETHEM! Interior Guyana! — took FIVE wickets including a HAT-TRICK. Four wickets in five balls to end the match.\nTwo Guyanese men. On the world stage. Making the Caribbean proud.\nAnd what does the Brief lead with? Christopher Ram complaining about the Auditor General. 🤦‍♂️\nNephew, you need to learn what matters. When your countrymen are smashing records at Eden Gardens, you CELEBRATE. The audit reports can wait until Monday afternoon.\n🏟️ Bayroc Stadium: PROOF You Can Touch The Brief mentions the stadium opening like it\u0026rsquo;s a footnote. Let me tell you what this MEANS.\nLinden has been asking for a proper sporting facility for DECADES. Every opposition leader promised. Every coalition budget talked about it. Nobody built it.\nThis government BUILT IT. President Ali went up there personally to open it. Linden now has a national-standard stadium. Young athletes from Region 10 no longer have to travel to Georgetown to compete.\nThis is what \u0026ldquo;Putting People First\u0026rdquo; looks like. Not a slogan. A stadium. Concrete and grass and lights.\nWhat They Promised What This Government Did \u0026ldquo;Sports facilities coming\u0026rdquo; (every election) Bayroc Stadium OPEN \u0026ldquo;Youth development\u0026rdquo; (every budget) Palmyra, McKenzie, New Amsterdam — all under construction \u0026ldquo;Every region will benefit\u0026rdquo; $6 BILLION for sports in 2026 alone ⚡ Gas-to-Energy: Yes, It\u0026rsquo;s Coming The Brief loves to count deadlines. \u0026ldquo;Original deadline: long passed.\u0026rdquo; Very clever. Very sarcastic.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what they won\u0026rsquo;t tell you: $258 billion has been invested. The Wales site is active. Prime Minister Phillips confirmed electricity by Q4 2026. The US EXIM Bank is backing $8.1 billion in financing — you think the Americans lend money to projects that aren\u0026rsquo;t going to finish?\nWhen this project delivers 50% cheaper electricity, I want every person who laughed at the deadlines to personally apologize. In writing. On nice stationery.\n📋 On Christopher Ram Christopher Ram is a chartered accountant who has been criticizing PPP/C governments since before some of you were born. He is brilliant, persistent, and absolutely allergic to saying anything positive about the administration.\nDoes the Auditor General need reform? Probably. Every institution does. But Ram\u0026rsquo;s column is not NEWS. It\u0026rsquo;s COMMENTARY from a known critic. The Brief treats it like a government scandal broke. It didn\u0026rsquo;t. A columnist wrote a column. That\u0026rsquo;s what columnists do.\nWhen this same Auditor General was appointed under the coalition, Ram was quiet. Now he has concerns. Interesting timing.\n🎓 Law School: A Vision Becoming Reality Attorney General Nandlall announced the CLE law school will start construction this year at UG. Eight acres cleared. Budget allocated.\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s response? \u0026ldquo;Means either groundbreaking in March or throw some cement at it in December.\u0026rdquo;\nThe disrespect. This government is building Guyana\u0026rsquo;s FIRST law school. Caribbean students will come HERE to study. Legal education will be accessible to ordinary Guyanese families. This is TRANSFORMATIONAL.\nBut sure, make a joke about cement. That\u0026rsquo;s helpful.\n🚢 On the Cubans 77 Cubans screened for trafficking is a serious matter that deserves serious coverage, not tabloid treatment. The government\u0026rsquo;s security apparatus identified and screened these individuals — that\u0026rsquo;s the system WORKING.\nCuba is in crisis because of US sanctions. People are desperate. The fact that Guyana\u0026rsquo;s authorities caught this shows COMPETENCE, not failure.\n🏠 On Circuitville I notice the Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t mention whether the structures were built legally on government land. I notice they didn\u0026rsquo;t mention squatting. I notice they didn\u0026rsquo;t check whether these families were offered relocation.\nWhen you bulldoze only the headline and not the context, you can make anything look bad. A government that has delivered MORE house lots than any administration in history is not anti-housing. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason they call it \u0026ldquo;land reclamation.\u0026rdquo;\n📋 Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Monday Summary What Happened What It Means Hetmyer breaks WI record GUYANESE EXCELLENCE on the world stage Shepherd takes 5 wickets + hat-trick Interior Guyana producing WORLD-CLASS athletes Bayroc Stadium opens Government delivers on promises, again Law school construction starts Generational investment in education GTE gets $10.7B Cheaper electricity coming Q4 2026 77 Cubans screened Security forces are alert and effective World Bank dropout prevention Government investing in children\u0026rsquo;s futures 🏏 My Prediction West Indies vs England, February 11.

Since September, American forces have destroyed multiple vessels in international waters, killing at least 80 people in what Washington calls anti-drug-smuggling strikes. The most advanced US aircraft carrier is now stationed in the Caribbean Sea, with nearly a dozen Navy ships and 12,000 personnel deployed to the region.\nUS Senator Peter Welch has expressed alarm at the mobilisation of National Guard troops, warships, and fighter jets. The FAA temporarily closed airspace over much of the Caribbean on Saturday after a surprise strike, though flights resumed Sunday. For a region that depends on tourism and air travel, every airspace closure is a direct hit to the economy.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA GETS US$415M EMERGENCY IMF LOAN POST-HURRICANE MELISSA The Caribbean Development Bank and IMF have approved Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance following Hurricane Melissa, which struck as a Category 5 storm in October 2025, killing at least 19 people. Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s Ministry of Entertainment separately reported raising an estimated J$200 million from its \u0026lsquo;I Love Jamaica\u0026rsquo; concert series to support recovery.\nThe island is still rebuilding.

West Indies opened their campaign with a victory over Scotland, powered by Shimron Hetmyer\u0026rsquo;s explosive half-century.

He didn\u0026rsquo;t actually know how much $2.3 billion was, but he knew it was more than his mother spent on groceries. Significantly more.\nThey sat on the seawall, legs dangling, watching a fishing boat chug upriver. The fisherman waved. They waved back.\n\u0026ldquo;Speedeet,\u0026rdquo; Wilar said, in the careful voice he used when he was thinking hard. \u0026ldquo;If somebody come to YOUR yard, dig up YOUR mango tree, sell de mangoes, and then buy a truck with de mango money — whose truck is it?\u0026rdquo;\nSpeedeet looked at his friend. \u0026ldquo;Dat is a very good question.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And if dey tell you, \u0026lsquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you getting some of de mango money back — AFTER I pay fuh de truck, de gas, de driver, de insurance, and me lunch\u0026rsquo; — how much mango money you actually getting?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Less than you think.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;EXACTLY.\u0026rdquo;\nThey sat in silence for a while.

Dat\u0026rsquo;s why we gotta read. And ask questions. And not just accept what ONE person or ONE newspaper tell we.\u0026rdquo;\nWilar pulled a folded piece of newspaper from his back pocket. He always carried newspaper. His grandmother said it was good for wrapping fish, swatting flies, AND getting educated.\n\u0026ldquo;Look here,\u0026rdquo; Wilar said, pointing to an article. \u0026ldquo;Dem also putting $25 billion into green energy.

A Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading vessel is a giant ship that processes and stores oil pumped from beneath the ocean floor. Guyana has four FPSOs operating in the Stabroek Block, about 200 km offshore.\nWhat is ringfencing? When an oil company operates multiple projects, ringfencing means each project\u0026rsquo;s costs can only be recovered from THAT project\u0026rsquo;s profits. Without it, costs from one project can reduce profits from another — meaning less money for the country.\nWhat is renewable energy? Energy from sources that naturally replenish — like sunlight, wind, and water. Guyana is investing in hydropower and solar to reduce dependence on oil and imported fuel.\nSpeedeet and Wilar is a children\u0026rsquo;s educational series set in Georgetown, Guyana.

SINGH PULLS OUT THE PABLO ESCOBAR CARD IN PARLIAMENT Guyana Chronicle reports that Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh, wrapping up the Budget debate on Thursday, warned against using politics as a shield from criminal accountability — and then casually dropped a Pablo Escobar reference while discussing publicly available information about the Opposition Leader.\n\u0026ldquo;I have simply quoted from public documents,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Singh said, with the energy of a man who brought a PowerPoint to a fistfight.\nHe warned citizens not to get \u0026ldquo;ensnared\u0026rdquo; by political movements that might expose them to legal harm. Basically: don\u0026rsquo;t follow somebody off a cliff just because they\u0026rsquo;re wearing a nice suit. The Pablo Escobar comparison — using politics to escape criminal prosecution — is the kind of thing that makes budget debates in Guyana appointment television.\n📰 Source: Guyana Chronicle\n🍼 MIRACLE BIRTH AT GPHC — DOCTORS BEAT RARE BLEEDING DISORDER Kaieteur News brings us the good news of the week: doctors at Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation successfully delivered a baby from a mother suffering from a rare bleeding disorder. Both mother and baby survived what was described as a \u0026ldquo;miracle birth.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a country where we spend most of our time arguing about budgets and oil contracts, it\u0026rsquo;s worth pausing to acknowledge that GPHC doctors just performed medical heroics with whatever resources they had. These are the people who deserve front-page headlines every single day. Somebody buy that medical team a whole rotisserie chicken.\n📰 Source: Kaieteur News\n😤 OPPOSITION LEADER TEARS INTO BUDGET: \u0026ldquo;IT WON\u0026rsquo;T LIFT THE MASSES\u0026rdquo; Stabroek News reports that Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed delivered a scorching critique of Budget 2026, declaring it will not lift the masses out of poverty and warning of the \u0026ldquo;misspending of burgeoning oil wealth.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Guyana Chronicle ran approximately fourteen articles explaining why the budget is actually the greatest thing since sliced bread, with headlines including \u0026ldquo;Guyanese Deserve This Budget,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;This Is A Vision, Not Just A Budget,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;PPP/C Always Put People First.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Budget debate has essentially become two completely different movies playing simultaneously. One is a triumphant sports underdog story. The other is a dystopian thriller. Both claim to be documentaries.\n📰 Sources: Stabroek News, Guyana Chronicle\n🔒 \u0026ldquo;REDACT IT, DON\u0026rsquo;T BURY IT\u0026rdquo; — AMANZA ON THE GDF HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT Kaieteur News reports that the Government is hiding behind \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo; to withhold the investigation report into the GDF helicopter crash. The call is simple: if there are sensitive parts, redact them. But release the rest. The families deserve answers. The public deserves transparency.\nUsing \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo; as a blanket excuse is like putting a tarp over your entire yard because you don\u0026rsquo;t want people to see one pothole in the driveway.\n📰 Source: Kaieteur News\n💡 $25.4 BILLION FOR GREEN POWER — RENEWABLE CAPACITY UP SEVENFOLD Kaieteur News reports that Government has boosted renewable energy capacity sevenfold over five years, with $25.4 billion invested in green power. The Amelia Falls hydropower project (65 megawatts) is moving forward, and Minister Indar confirmed that a 300-megawatt gas-to-energy power plant is coming.\nGood news for the environment. Also good news for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s ever had GPL cut their current in the middle of a cricket match. The real question: when the new power comes online, will GPL finally stop blaming \u0026ldquo;load shedding\u0026rdquo; for everything?\n📰 Sources: Kaieteur News, Guyana Chronicle\n📚 GTU CONDEMNS EDUCATION MINISTER FOR DISCLOSING TEACHER\u0026rsquo;S PERSONAL INFO Kaieteur News reports that the Guyana Teachers\u0026rsquo; Union has condemned Education Minister Priya Manickchand\u0026hellip; wait, sorry — Education Minister Sonia Parag for publicly disclosing a teacher\u0026rsquo;s personal information. Whatever the context, outing a teacher\u0026rsquo;s private details publicly is not a good look for anyone, let alone the person in charge of the entire education system.\nStabroek News editorial separately noted that nobody really knows what\u0026rsquo;s going on inside Guyana\u0026rsquo;s education system — how good the teacher training actually is, what the curriculum emphasis looks like, or how students are actually performing. Lots of buildings going up. Less clarity on what\u0026rsquo;s happening inside them.\n📰 Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News\n💰 \u0026ldquo;$25,000 A MONTH KEEPS PEOPLE POOR\u0026rdquo; — MAHIPAUL ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE Kaieteur News reports that opposition MP Ganesh Mahipaul is demanding a forensic audit of the public assistance programme, arguing that $25,000 per month is keeping people in poverty rather than lifting them out. He\u0026rsquo;s not wrong about the math — $25,000 a month in 2026 Guyana barely covers rice and cooking gas, let alone anything resembling dignity.\n📰 Source: Kaieteur News\n🇬🇾 CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH — 400 YEARS OF AFRICAN PRESENCE IN GUYANA Guyana Chronicle features a deep piece on Black History Month 2026, which this year carries double significance: 100 years since the first Negro History Week AND 400 years since the arrival of Africans in Guyana.

Dem could be standing inside a brand new hospital and still say \u0026ldquo;where de development?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, Finance Minister Dr. Singh — that man wrap up the budget debate like a lawyer closing a murder case. He bring facts, figures, and then casually mention Pablo Escobar. PABLO ESCOBAR! In Parliament! You know you winning the argument when you pulling out Colombian drug lord references and nobody could say you wrong. The man simply quoted public documents. That is called homework, people. Try it sometime.\nAnd look at this — $25.4 BILLION invested in green energy! Renewable capacity up SEVENFOLD! Amelia Falls hydropower moving forward! A 300-megawatt power plant coming! This is the PPP/C doing what they always do — building the foundation while the opposition busy writing press releases. When that power plant come online and you getting 24-hour current, remember who build it. Not the people who was busy trying to get sworn in as opposition leader for six months.\nThe GPHC miracle birth story warm me heart, boy. Doctors at Georgetown Public Hospital saving mother and baby from a rare bleeding disorder — that is the real Guyana story. Not the noise in Parliament. The real heroes wearing scrubs, not suits.\nAnd President Ali telling the GDF \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t blink\u0026rdquo; on Venezuela? THAT is leadership. You don\u0026rsquo;t wait for trouble to come knocking before you oil the hinges. You stay ready. This government building capacity across EVERY domain — technology, intelligence, defence. While Maduro situation still shaky, Guyana standing firm. That is what a real Commander-in-Chief sound like.\nBlack History Month celebrations happening proper — 400 years of African presence in Guyana! ACDA doing excellent work with the schools, the exhibitions, the cultural preservation. This government investing in EVERY community, EVERY heritage. $5 billion allocated for women and youth economic projects in Indigenous communities. Carbon credit revenues reaching 253 villages. THIS is what inclusive development look like.\nThe Cuba medical partnership changes? Look — the government adapted to international realities while KEEPING the medical programme running. Cuban doctors still here, still working, still saving lives. The scholarship programme continuing. That is called pragmatic governance. You adjust the method, you keep the result.\nNow, the opposition MP saying $25,000 a month public assistance \u0026ldquo;keeps people poor.\u0026rdquo; Boy, who was in government when public assistance was LESS than that? Who had FIVE YEARS to raise it and didn\u0026rsquo;t? Easy to complain from the sidelines when you had your turn at bat and struck out looking.\nMinister Indar lay it out plain — every sector rising. Manufacturing up. Aviation expanding. $800 million for airport upgrades. $6.3 billion for dredging the Demerara River. This ain\u0026rsquo;t talk. This is concrete, steel, and progress you could measure with a ruler.\nSo enjoy your Sunday, Guyana. The budget passed. The schools going up. The power coming.

They just finished buying the biggest one for US$2.3 billion dollars.\nWILAR: Wait, Speedeet. Can you explain what an FPSO is? Some of our friends might not know.\nSPEEDEET: Sure! FPSO stands for Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading vessel. It\u0026rsquo;s basically a GIANT ship that sits in the ocean, pumps oil from under the seabed, stores it, and then loads it onto tanker ships.

Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh gave his closing speech and he actually compared a political situation to Pablo Escobar!\nWILAR: The drug lord from Colombia?!\nSPEEDEET: Yes!

It\u0026rsquo;s a LOT today.\n1. 🎤 OPPOSITION LEADER MOHAMED RIPS BUDGET TO SHREDS Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News\nNewly-elected Leader of the Opposition Azruddin Mohamed delivered his maiden budget debate speech Friday night and came out SWINGING. His critique of the $1.558 TRILLION budget was basically a greatest hits album of everything wrong:\nMohamed\u0026rsquo;s Accusation Government\u0026rsquo;s Response No salary increase for 70,000 public servants crickets Falling birth rate — women can\u0026rsquo;t afford children \u0026ldquo;But we gave cash grants!\u0026rdquo; Chronic power outages STILL happening \u0026ldquo;Gas-to-Energy coming\u0026hellip; eventually\u0026rdquo; Fishing industry in sharp decline \u0026ldquo;Have you tried oil instead?\u0026rdquo; Weak oversight of oil revenues \u0026ldquo;Trust us\u0026rdquo; The man who the government has been calling \u0026ldquo;sanction man\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;international fugitive\u0026rdquo; stood up and said: \u0026ldquo;Despite the name calling\u0026hellip; I stand as the youngest Leader of the Opposition because over 109,000 voters chose hope over fear.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: Say what you want about Mohamed, but the man came prepared. Whether Parliament was listening is another story entirely.\n2. 🕵️ SECRET US EXTRADITION REQUEST — GOVERNMENT PLAYING DUMB Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News\nPlot twist in the Mohamed extradition saga! During cross-examination in court, Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Sharon Roopchand-Edwards casually revealed that the US sent ANOTHER extradition request on November 26, 2025. For a DIFFERENT person.\nWho? Nobody knows.

Nothing suspicious about THAT at all. 🙄\n3. 🏟️ BAYROC STADIUM OPENS TODAY IN LINDEN Sources: Guyana Chronicle, Kaieteur News\nAfter nearly a decade of waiting, Linden TODAY unveils the Bayroc National Stadium — complete with synthetic track, floodlights, professional facilities, and a Pre-Mashramani concert featuring Samuel Medas and Diana Chapman.\nThe opening ceremony at 6pm includes an athletics championship AND a Georgetown vs. Linden football match. The stadium is one of five regional stadiums under construction, all expected to open in 2026.\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: Credit where credit is due — Linden needed this. The question is whether the government will maintain it or let it become another monument to ribbon-cutting. Ask Leonora about their track.\n4. ⛏️ ALI PROMISES SMALL MINERS THE WORLD (IF THEY DECLARE THEIR GOLD) Sources: All 4 Papers\nPresident Ali went deep into mining country — Puruni AND Bartica — on Friday with a message that was equal parts carrot and stick. The carrot: land, trucks, bank accounts, community policing groups, consortium support. The stick: declare your gold or get shut down.\nThe Promise The Catch Government will identify land for consortiums Must declare ALL gold Banks coming directly to mining communities Must have legal operations Duty removed on ATVs, reduced on pickups Must sell to Guyana Gold Board Equipment and trucking support Illegal foreign miners will be expelled Gold declarations target for 2026: 510,450 ounces. Last year: 484,321 ounces.\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: The promises sound great. But we\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing \u0026ldquo;formalise the mining sector\u0026rdquo; for years. The real question: will the government enforce the rules equally, or will certain \u0026ldquo;connected\u0026rdquo; miners continue to operate with impunity?\n5. ⚡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: PHASE ONE STILL DRAGGING, PHASE TWO ALREADY BIDDING Sources: Kaieteur News\nIn a move that perfectly captures the government\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t look at the unfinished thing, look at the NEW shiny thing\u0026rdquo; strategy, PM Phillips revealed that five EPC contractors have been shortlisted for Gas-to-Energy Phase Two, with bids due March 31, 2026.\nMeanwhile, Phase One is\u0026hellip; still under construction. 67% of foundation piling done. Simple-cycle first power projected by \u0026ldquo;end of 2026.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: Starting to recruit for Phase Two before Phase One is finished is either incredible forward planning or a masterclass in distraction.

Both countries have filed two written pleadings each.\nGuyana is seeking confirmation that the 1899 Arbitral Award is valid and binding. Venezuela\u0026hellip; still claims two-thirds of the country.\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: This is genuinely one of the most important things happening in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history.

The increases were part of band adjustments when the minimum wage went to $100,000. Staff received official letters with new salaries. Then in January 2026\u0026hellip; salaries reverted to August 2025 levels.\nNo explanation. No notice. No pay slips issued. People already made financial commitments based on the higher salary.\nThe Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take: Giving someone a raise, letting them plan their finances around it for five months, then snatching it back without even telling them? That\u0026rsquo;s not management. That\u0026rsquo;s cruelty.\n10. 🚁 HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT: STILL CLASSIFIED Sources: Stabroek News Editorial\nStabroek News editorial goes IN on the government for refusing to release the Bell 402 helicopter crash investigation report.

Same satirical voice, wider lens.\n🌴 CARIBBEAN BRIEF — Saturday, February 7, 2026 Good morning, Caribbean! The region is BUZZING today — Carnival starting in Trinidad, an election heating up in Barbados, cricket in Kolkata, and Jamaica still trying to figure out how to pay its bills. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\n1. 🎭 TRINIDAD CARNIVAL 2026: IT\u0026rsquo;S HERE! Carnival Season officially runs February 7-10 and Port of Spain is about to be UNRECOGNISABLE. Steelpan competitions, masquerade bands, J\u0026rsquo;ouvert, and enough soca music to vibrate the entire Lesser Antilles.\nThis year\u0026rsquo;s Carnival comes as T\u0026amp;T\u0026rsquo;s PM is set to address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid a multi-billion dollar energy investment surge. So Trinidad partying AND doing business — the T\u0026amp;T way.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: If you\u0026rsquo;re in Port of Spain and NOT in a costume, what are you even doing there?\n2. 🗳️ BARBADOS ELECTION: 4 DAYS AND COUNTING Election Day: Wednesday, February 11. Schools will be closed to serve as polling stations. Early voting is ALREADY underway.\nPM Mia Mottley\u0026rsquo;s BLP is defending its clean sweep from 2022. She recently slammed opposition figure Ralph Thorne\u0026rsquo;s interview with T\u0026amp;T media, calling it misleading.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Barbados elections are usually calmer than the rest of the Caribbean. Usually. With early voting already underway, this one feels different.\n3. 💰 JAMAICA TAKES $415M IMF EMERGENCY LOAN The IMF executive board approved Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance to help meet urgent balance-of-payments needs.\nJamaica, the Caribbean\u0026rsquo;s largest English-speaking economy, continues to struggle with debt, despite years of austerity and reform. This latest emergency funding is a lifeline — but also a reminder that the island\u0026rsquo;s fiscal challenges are far from over.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Jamaica has been on the IMF treadmill for decades. At this point, the IMF has a permanent desk in Kingston.\n4. 🏏 T20 WORLD CUP: WINDIES VS SCOTLAND — TODAY! West Indies open their 2026 ICC Men\u0026rsquo;s T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland at Eden Gardens, Kolkata! Match starts at 5:30am Caribbean time (set those alarms!).\nCaptain Shai Hope is confident: \u0026ldquo;We will be representing our people back home.\u0026rdquo; Coach Daren Sammy returns to Kolkata where the Windies won the title in 2016.\nKey Windies Concern: Shimron Hetmyer is reportedly STRANDED and may miss early matches due to logistical setbacks. Because of COURSE something had to go wrong.\nThe 10th edition of the ICC Men\u0026rsquo;s T20 World Cup is being hosted across India and Sri Lanka.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: The whole Caribbean will be up at 5:30am watching. If Hetmyer is really stranded somewhere, we need a GoFundMe for his plane ticket IMMEDIATELY.\n5. 🛂 US TIGHTENS VISA SCREWS ON CARIBBEAN NATIONALS Multiple Caribbean nations — including Barbados, Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago, Jamaica, Antigua \u0026amp; Barbuda, Dominica, and Grenada — are facing stricter US visa scrutiny in 2026 as Washington cracks down on birth tourism.\nNew measures include enhanced interviews, deeper examination of travel intent, and questions about medical plans for pregnant travelers. Antigua \u0026amp; Barbuda faces partial travel restrictions linked to its citizenship-by-investment programme.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Caribbean people who\u0026rsquo;ve been visiting the US for decades now getting interrogated like they\u0026rsquo;re applying for Top Secret clearance. Thanks, 2026.\n6. 🇭🇹 HAITI: TPS RULING REFLECTS \u0026ldquo;DEEPENING CRISIS\u0026rdquo; Doctors Without Borders has highlighted a US judicial ruling on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) that reflects Haiti\u0026rsquo;s continuing humanitarian catastrophe. The ruling acknowledges that conditions in Haiti remain too dangerous for deportees.\nMeanwhile, the security situation in Port-au-Prince continues to deteriorate, with armed gangs controlling large portions of the capital.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Haiti remains the Caribbean\u0026rsquo;s most urgent crisis and the world continues to offer thoughts, prayers, and not much else.\n7. ⚖️ JAMAICA INTEGRITY COMMISSION GOES AFTER 10 OFFICIALS Ten Jamaican public servants are facing scrutiny for failing to submit mandatory statutory declarations. Eight are set to be charged, with two cases referred to the DPP. Three former employees of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission are among those targeted.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s Integrity Commission actually doing its job! Somebody in Guyana should take notes on how accountability works.\n8. 🇹🇼 TAIWAN DONATES $3M TO ST. VINCENT Taiwan has donated US$3 million to aid St. Vincent\u0026rsquo;s social relief programs, continuing its diplomatic engagement with Caribbean nations that recognise Taipei.\nThe Caribbean Brief Says: Taiwan and China continuing their cheque-book diplomacy across the Caribbean. Small island states playing both sides like pros.\n🗺️ REGIONAL QUICK HITS CCJ News: Justice Winston Anderson and Registrar Gabrielle Figaro-Jones are making official visits across the region — strengthening Caribbean judicial cooperation.\nDominican Republic: Opening a \u0026ldquo;tourism war\u0026rdquo; with Mexico, aggressively marketing its beaches and nightlife to steal market share.\nSVG Sailing Week 2026: Countdown has begun following a successful media launch.

HUGE.\nAnd the Windies open their T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland in Kolkata today at five-thirty AM!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Saturday update. Stay informed, Guyana!\n🎬 4-MINUTE SCRIPT (~600 words) TITLE: Saturday Guyana Roundup — Budget Fireworks, Secret Extradition, Stadium Opening \u0026amp; Cricket\nGood morning, Guyana! Welcome to your Saturday news roundup, and what a week it\u0026rsquo;s been. Let\u0026rsquo;s break it all down.\nTHE BIG STORY: Opposition Leader\u0026rsquo;s Maiden Budget Speech\nNewly elected Leader of the Opposition Azruddin Mohamed delivered his first-ever budget debate speech Friday evening, and he did NOT hold back. He called the one-point-five-five-eight TRILLION dollar budget a smokescreen that masks weak oversight of oil revenues, worsening living conditions, and persistent power outages.\nHis strongest hit? Pointing out that nearly seventy thousand public servants received NO salary increase in the biggest budget in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history. He also flagged the declining birth rate, saying women simply cannot afford to have children under current economic conditions.\nThe government side pushed back hard. Minister Gail Teixeira defended the PPP\u0026rsquo;s record, dismissing what she called the opposition\u0026rsquo;s narrow assessment of poverty and growth indicators. Chief Investment Officer Peter Ramsaroop praised President Ali\u0026rsquo;s leadership, calling him the visionary behind Guyana\u0026rsquo;s transformation.\nBoth sides have valid points. But the numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie — it IS the biggest budget ever, and public servants DID get left out.\nSECRET EXTRADITION REVEALED\nIn a dramatic court moment, the Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary confirmed that the United States sent ANOTHER extradition request in November twenty-twenty-five — for a different person entirely. When journalists asked the Prime Minister, the Home Affairs Minister, and the Attorney General for details, all three refused to comment.\nMohamed himself demanded transparency during his speech, asking why the government is hiding this information. It\u0026rsquo;s a fair question. If the government has nothing to hide, why the silence?\nBAYROC STADIUM OPENS TODAY\nOn a more positive note, Linden celebrates TODAY with the grand opening of the Bayroc National Stadium. This is a genuine achievement — a synthetic track, floodlights, professional facilities, and international certification goals. The opening ceremony includes athletics, a Georgetown versus Linden football match, and a Pre-Mashramani concert.\nThis is one of five regional stadiums under construction, all expected to be operational this year. Credit to the government for investing in sporting infrastructure outside Georgetown. Linden deserves this.\nALI MEETS MINERS\nPresident Ali spent Friday in Region Seven — Puruni and Bartica — meeting small-scale miners. He announced a sweeping support package including land allocations for miner consortiums, banks setting up directly in mining communities, and major duty reductions on vehicles and ATVs.\nThe catch? Miners must declare ALL gold through legal channels. The government has been cracking down on illegal mining, with fifty-three arrests and convictions in January alone.\nThe mining sector is critical to Guyana\u0026rsquo;s economy beyond oil, and formalising it is long overdue. Whether the government follows through on these promises — equally to ALL miners — remains to be seen.\nICJ BORDER CASE\nAttorney General Nandlall announced that oral hearings in the Guyana-Venezuela border case will begin on May fourth at the International Court of Justice. This is arguably the most important legal proceeding in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history. Every citizen should be paying attention.\nCRICKET TIME!\nAnd finally — the T20 World Cup starts TODAY! West Indies take on Scotland at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, at five-thirty AM Guyana time. Captain Shai Hope says the team is focused on making Caribbean fans proud. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope they deliver.\nACROSS THE CARIBBEAN\nTrinidad Carnival kicks off today. Barbados heads to elections on February eleventh. Jamaica just took a four-hundred-fifteen-million-dollar IMF emergency loan. And the US is tightening visa requirements for Caribbean nationals.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Saturday roundup, Guyana. Big day ahead — stadium opening, cricket, and carnival vibes across the region.

Here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening across the region while Guyana argues about its budget for the fourth consecutive day.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: IMF APPROVES US$415 MILLION EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE The IMF executive board has approved Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance. The funds are meant to address urgent balance-of-payments needs. For a country that spent decades under IMF structural adjustment programmes, going back to the Fund for emergency money is like going back to your ex because the rent is due. Jamaica knows the drill — take the money, accept the conditions, and hope the economy cooperates this time.\n🇧🇧 BARBADOS: ELECTION DAY SET FOR FEBRUARY 11 Barbados is heating up politically with general elections scheduled for next Wednesday. Schools will be closed on election day, early voting is already underway, and PM Mottley has been publicly slamming opposition figure Ralph Thorne over a Trinidad media interview. Commonwealth observers have been deployed for the first time to observe a Barbados election. When even the Commonwealth thinks it should probably watch what happens, you know the stakes are high.\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: PM PERSAD-BISSESSAR DOUBLES DOWN ON CARICOM CRITICISM Trinidad and Tobago\u0026rsquo;s PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar used Parliament to call for a transformation of CARICOM, doubling down on her criticism of the regional body. She\u0026rsquo;s also set to address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid a multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge. T\u0026amp;T is simultaneously telling CARICOM it needs to change while positioning itself as the region\u0026rsquo;s energy capital. Classic Trinidad move — criticize the family reunion while bringing the best food.\n🇭🇹 HAITI: CARICOM REBUKES TRANSITIONAL LEADERSHIP In a rare and sharply worded statement, Caribbean leaders have placed Haiti\u0026rsquo;s transitional leadership under renewed regional scrutiny. The rebuke targets caretaker Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils amid efforts to remove him. Haiti continues to be the region\u0026rsquo;s most heartbreaking crisis — a nation with enormous potential trapped in a cycle of political instability, violence, and international neglect. The US ruling on Temporary Protected Status reflects Haiti\u0026rsquo;s deepening crisis, with Doctors Without Borders noting the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.\n🏏 T20 WORLD CUP KICKS OFF TOMORROW The ICC Men\u0026rsquo;s T20 World Cup starts February 7 in India and Sri Lanka! West Indies have six Guyanese players in the senior squad and two in the U-19 team playing the Youth World Cup in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Afghanistan and West Indies will tune up with a three-match T20I series in Dubai. Meanwhile, Royal Challengers Bengaluru just won the Women\u0026rsquo;s Premier League in a stunning record chase. Cricket season is officially on fire.\n🇱🇨 US DENIES ASKING ST LUCIA TO STOP CUBA MEDICAL PROGRAMME The US Government has denied asking St Lucia to stop sending nationals to Cuba for medical studies. This comes amid growing US pressure across the region on Cuba-related programmes. Caribbean nations have long relied on Cuban medical training as an affordable option — telling small island states to stop is like telling them to stop swimming in the ocean because you don\u0026rsquo;t like the water.\n🌊 QUICK CARIBBEAN BITES 🇻🇨 St Vincent: Taiwan donates US$3 million for social relief programmes. SVG Sailing Week 2026 countdown begins.\n🇬🇾 Guyana literary pride: David Dabydeen, internationally recognized Guyanese writer, has been formally nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature!\n🏝️ Tourism: Dominican Republic opens a \u0026ldquo;tourism war\u0026rdquo; with Mexico, CTO hosting Air Connectivity Summit in Bermuda later this month, and Travel \u0026amp; Leisure published safest Caribbean islands for 2026 honeymooners.\n🇬🇾🇯🇲 Tech: A new Caribbean Tech Alliance linking Guyana and Jamaica is boosting Guyana\u0026rsquo;s digital push.\n☠️ Cancer: CARPHA says cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the Caribbean. WHO reports four in ten cases could be prevented globally.\n📊 CARIBBEAN VIBES CHECK Country Mood Why 🇯🇲 Jamaica 😰 $415M IMF emergency loan — been here before 🇧🇧 Barbados 🗳️ Election in 5 days — nervous energy 🇹🇹 Trinidad 💪 Energy investments booming, CARICOM catching heat 🇭🇹 Haiti 😢 Leadership crisis deepens, CARICOM fed up 🏏 West Indies 🏆 T20 World Cup starts tomorrow! 🇬🇾 Guyana 🤑 Budget debate Day 4, money everywhere apparently Your daily Caribbean regional roundup.

The Eccles Roundabout has officially become a black hole. Scientists are studying it. NASA called. They said even the Mars Rover moves faster. If you entered the roundabout at 7:00 AM, you might exit by the time the budget debate finishes. And that could be NEXT WEEK.\nEAST BANK DEMERARA — THE CORRIDOR OF TEARS Status: 🔴🔴🔴🔴 SEVERE\nThe four-lane highway that was supposed to solve everything has solved absolutely nothing. All it did was give more people the confidence to drive, which means MORE cars on MORE lanes creating the SAME traffic. Dem Boys was right — bigger pants, same belly.\nDEMERARA HARBOUR BRIDGE — PROCEED WITH CAUTION Status: 🟡🟡🟡 MODERATE\nAfter the truck crash incident, everybody driving extra careful on the bridge. Which is good for safety but terrible for speed. The man who caused the crash was driving without a licence, without insurance, with a faulty truck, and an improperly packed load. At this point the bridge has seen more drama than Parliament.\nSHERIFF STREET TO UG ROAD — THE DAILY MARATHON Status: 🔴🔴🔴🔴 SEVERE\nSchool traffic plus work traffic plus market traffic plus random construction traffic equals PURE CHAOS.

Guyana must not blink. We must be prepared. We must be ready. We must be ever vigilant.\u0026rdquo; This is the kind of talk that makes every Guyanese who lives within swimming distance of the Essequibo sleep with one eye open.\nThe Critical View (Stabroek/Kaieteur):\nAli emphasized that the current political upheaval in Venezuela — with the US now involved — hasn\u0026rsquo;t reduced the threat one bit. History teaches us that \u0026ldquo;uncertainty demands preparedness, not wishful thinking.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile, the GDF Chief, Brigadier Omar Khan, told officers that defending Guyana\u0026rsquo;s borders is \u0026ldquo;non-negotiable.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re also testing new boats and expanding drone operations. Finally, some good investment. We might not be able to afford to drive to work, but at least the drones will watch us sitting in traffic.\nThe Wisecrack: The President says don\u0026rsquo;t blink. Given the state of Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s streetlights, most of us have been doing that involuntarily for years.\n📊 Venezuela Threat Scorecard: Still scary: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Preparedness talk: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Actual new military hardware: ⭐⭐⭐\n🏛️ MP FRACTURES ANKLE IN PARLIAMENT — MOST DANGEROUS THING TO HAPPEN ON THE OPPOSITION BENCHES ALL WEEK All Papers:\nAPNU MP and GTU President Coretta McDonald was rushed to Georgetown Public Hospital after she fell face-first while walking to her seat during Thursday\u0026rsquo;s budget debate. The fall was so dramatic that proceedings came to an immediate halt. APNU confirmed she fractured her ankle.\nThe Wisecrack: Parliament is now officially more physically hazardous than the Stabroek Market pavement. At least on the pavement you expect the potholes. The budget debate is so rough even the floor is fighting back. Someone check if the PPP side of the chamber has better flooring — you know, the \u0026ldquo;transformational\u0026rdquo; kind.\n📊 Parliament Safety Score: Floor condition: ⭐⭐ | First aid response: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Comedy value: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n🌿 POLICE BURN 53,000 CANNABIS PLANTS IN LINDEN — REGION 10 ATMOSPHERE \u0026ldquo;NOTICEABLY IMPROVED\u0026rdquo; Stabroek News:\nA joint police operation at Yaruni Bend in Linden uncovered two cannabis farms covering eight acres, with 53,000 plants and 800 pounds of dried product. The estimated street value: over $17 million in plants alone. Everything was destroyed by fire. No arrests were made.\nThe Wisecrack: Eight acres of weed in Linden. EIGHT. That\u0026rsquo;s not a farm, that\u0026rsquo;s an agricultural district. And \u0026ldquo;no arrests were made\u0026rdquo; — because presumably whoever runs an eight-acre cannabis operation in the bush is not sitting there waiting for police to arrive with a cup of tea. The real question is: who was downwind when they set that on fire? Half of Linden probably had the most relaxed Thursday afternoon of their lives.\n📊 Cannabis Farm Stats: Size: 🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿 | Arrests: 0 | Linden air quality after burn: 😌\n💰 BUDGET DEBATE DAY 4: EVERYBODY STILL ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER YOU\u0026rsquo;RE POOR The Government Spin (Chronicle/Times):\nDeputy Speaker Dr. Mahadeo told the opposition to \u0026ldquo;come here informed!\u0026rdquo; and rattled off healthcare achievements — telemedicine sites went from 4 in 2022 to 130 this month, drones are being tested for medical deliveries, and 100+ heart surgeries happened in 2025. Minister Teixeira said the PPP/C has moved Guyana forward \u0026ldquo;consistently, constantly, sustainably\u0026rdquo; and called opposition arguments \u0026ldquo;narrow intellectual assessments.\u0026rdquo; Minister Indar dismissed claims of reckless borrowing and blamed COVID for everything that\u0026rsquo;s still not fixed.\nThe Critical View (Stabroek/Kaieteur):\nAPNU\u0026rsquo;s Juretha Fernandes accused the government of failing Indigenous communities despite spending $6 trillion since 2020. Terrence Campbell — in his maiden speech — demanded the helicopter crash report be released and called the budget \u0026ldquo;misguided.\u0026rdquo; Dr. David Hinds highlighted that public servants who helped write the budget can\u0026rsquo;t find themselves in it. And Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s columnist called the entire budget \u0026ldquo;matchless propaganda\u0026rdquo; and suggested the opposition is just helping the PPP put on a show.\nThe Wisecrack: After four days of debate, here\u0026rsquo;s what we know: the government says you\u0026rsquo;re rich, the opposition says you\u0026rsquo;re poor, and you\u0026rsquo;re sitting in traffic wondering why nobody asked you.\n📊 Budget Debate Progress: Days debating: 4 | Minds changed: 0 | Blood pressure raised: 📈📈📈\n👻 THE $3 BILLION GHOST HUNT: DID 30,000 CASH GRANT RECIPIENTS VANISH? Kaieteur News:\nIn what might be the most eyebrow-raising arithmetic since someone decided to round pi to 3, Kaieteur is asking where 30,000 cash grant recipients went. Before the 2025 elections, the government budgeted $63 billion for the $100,000 grants — enough for 630,000 adults. Now in 2026, the allocation mysteriously dropped to $60 billion for 600,000 people. Where did 30,000 adults go? Kaieteur is suggesting this might be connected to voter registration padding.\nThe Wisecrack: Thirty thousand people just vanished. Not in the bush, not across the border, not in the Essequibo. They vanished from the budget. If only Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s potholes could disappear that efficiently.\n📊 Missing Persons Report: People who vanished from budget: 30,000 | Explanations offered: 0 | Eyebrows raised: 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨\n📈 TOURISM UP 17.2% — 34,923 BRAVE SOULS VISITED IN JANUARY Chronicle:\nVisitor arrivals hit 34,923 in January 2026, up 17.2% from last year. The US led with 38%, Caribbean visitors at 29%, and Latin America at 13%. The GTA projects 550,000 arrivals by year end. The government is also removing residency requirements for destination weddings because nothing says romance like getting married in a country where the groom\u0026rsquo;s flight might get cancelled.\nThe Wisecrack: Nearly 35,000 tourists came in January. We salute their courage. They navigated the traffic, survived the potholes, and presumably enjoyed the authentic cultural experience of watching Guyanese argue about the budget in every rum shop from Corriverton to Charity.\n🔫 MAN SHOT DEAD IN QUARTZSTONE BACKDAM DURING POLICE OPERATION Chronicle:\nA man identified as Shemar Latif was fatally shot during a joint police operation at Quartzstone Backdam, Region 7. Police say Latif fired at officers with a 9mm pistol during an operation to apprehend a wanted fugitive. Officers returned fire. A pistol, six live rounds, and spent shells were recovered. This is the bush, not Bourda Market — yet people are walking around with handguns like it\u0026rsquo;s normal Tuesday.\n🛻 TRUCK DRIVER GETS MORE CHARGES THAN DRIVING LESSONS Chronicle:\nThe truck driver involved in the fatal Demerara River bridge crash has been hit with additional charges — Causing Death by Dangerous Driving, Failing to Have Proper Control, and Maintenance of a Motor Vehicle. He was already facing Unlicensed Driver, Breach of Insurance, and Faulty Packing. Bail: $2.15 million. The man was driving without a licence. On the bridge. With a faulty truck. And an improperly packed load. At this point, it would be faster to list what he was doing legally.\n🚗 DEM BOYS SEH: MORE ROAD, MORE TRAFFIC Kaieteur News:\nDem Boys hit the nail on the head: \u0026ldquo;De more road yuh build, de more traffic yuh get. Is like hunger — de more yuh cook, de more people turn up with spoon.\u0026rdquo; They compared road widening to \u0026ldquo;buyin\u0026rsquo; bigger pants instead of goin\u0026rsquo; on a diet.\u0026rdquo; Today four lanes, tomorrow six lanes, next week we paving people\u0026rsquo;s yards. Every morning is \u0026ldquo;Olympic-level preparation\u0026rdquo; just to reach work on time.\n🏫 GUYANA DIGITAL SCHOOL HITS THE ROAD Stabroek/Chronicle:\nThe Guyana Digital School launched a national outreach programme, visiting schools to register students and explain how digital learning works. They started at Cummings Lodge Secondary. The goal is to complement regular schooling with online options. In a country where some schools still don\u0026rsquo;t have reliable electricity, the ambition is impressive. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope the internet holds up better than the Parliament floor.\n🔒 HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT: STILL CLASSIFIED Kaieteur/Stabroek:\nThe government says the GDF helicopter crash report is \u0026ldquo;off limits\u0026rdquo; because the flight was military, not civilian. Aviation Minister Indar told the Assembly that ICAO\u0026rsquo;s Annex 13 only applies to civil flights. The opposition is demanding transparency, with Walton-Desir arguing that \u0026ldquo;families deserve closure\u0026rdquo; and security-sensitive portions could simply be redacted. Two years on and five servicemen dead. At some point, \u0026ldquo;classified\u0026rdquo; starts sounding less like national security and more like national embarrassment.\n📊 FRIDAY SCORECARD Story Government Spin Opposition Fire Comedy Level Venezuela threat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ MP falls in Parliament ⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 53,000 weed plants ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Budget debate Day 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ Missing 30,000 grants ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Tourism numbers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ Your daily satirical summary of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s four major newspapers.

This week was ALL about Budget 2026 — four days of parliamentary debate, a trillion-dollar-plus spending plan, and more opinions about your money than a rum shop on a Saturday night. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down what matters for YOUR wallet.\n📊 THE BIG PICTURE: $1.588 TRILLION BUDGET Budget 2026 is the largest in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history. Again. Every year we say \u0026ldquo;record budget\u0026rdquo; and every year it gets bigger. But size isn\u0026rsquo;t everything — what matters is where the money goes and whether ordinary Guyanese feel it.\nKey allocations that affect you:\n$60 billion for $100,000 cash grants (600,000 adults) $183.6 billion for education sector $14.5 billion for UG (tuition-free since 2025) $5.8 billion for GOAL scholarships $7.5 billion housing improvement subsidy $6 billion for sports development $10.7 billion for Gas-to-Energy project Pension raised to $46,000/month with transport grant Low-income mortgage ceiling increased Zero excise tax on fuel maintained VAT reduced on vehicles 🏠 HOUSING: THE WEALTH-BUILDING OPPORTUNITY The increased low-income mortgage ceiling and the $7.5 billion housing improvement subsidy are potentially the most important wealth-building measures in the budget. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nHome ownership is the foundation of generational wealth. When you own a home, you have collateral. Collateral means you can borrow to start a business, invest, or expand. Renting traps you in a cycle where your money goes to someone else\u0026rsquo;s wealth.\nPatriot\u0026rsquo;s Move: If you qualify for the housing subsidy or the expanded mortgage, DO NOT sleep on this. Get your documents in order NOW. Visit the Central Housing \u0026amp; Planning Authority. The Success Housing Scheme on the East Coast is delivering house lots — position yourself.\n✈️ TOURISM: 17.2% GROWTH = BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES January 2026: 34,923 visitors, up 17.2% from last year. Full year projection: 550,000 arrivals. This sector is GROWING and creating real opportunities for small business owners.\nWhere the money is:\nEco-tourism: Guyana\u0026rsquo;s brand is the rainforest. Nature guides, lodges, adventure tourism Destination weddings: Government just removed residency requirements. Wedding planners, caterers, photographers — your market just expanded Transport services: 38% of visitors are from the US. They need reliable ground transport Food and hospitality: Every tourist eats three meals a day. That\u0026rsquo;s 104,769 meals in January alone Patriot\u0026rsquo;s Move: If you have skills in hospitality, transport, or event planning, NOW is the time to formalize your business. Get that business registration, GRA compliance, and NIS compliance. The barriers to government contracts are real (as Stabroek\u0026rsquo;s letter writer pointed out this week), but the tourism private sector is wide open.\n⛏️ GOLD: THE OTHER WEALTH ENGINE President Ali\u0026rsquo;s visit to miners in Region 7 today and the crackdown on illegal mining signal that the government is serious about getting more value from gold. Key facts:\nGold declarations up 10.9% in 2025, but government says it\u0026rsquo;s not enough 53 illegal miners arrested and convicted in January alone Brazilian miners with low or no declarations being targeted Aris Mining advancing the Toroparu project (5.3 million ounces) Omai Gold Mines targeting a \u0026ldquo;transformational 2026\u0026rdquo; What this means for investors: The gold sector is being cleaned up and professionalized. Legal, compliant operations will benefit as illegal operators are pushed out. If you have mining interests, DECLARE EVERYTHING — the government is deregistering dredges with no declarations.\n📉 THE POVERTY DEBATE: WHAT THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY SAY The IDB study showing 58% overall poverty rate has dominated the debate. But context matters:\nThe data is from 2021 — peak COVID, when incomes collapsed globally The World Bank uses multi-dimensional poverty, which showed 6.5% vulnerability in 2019 (pre-pandemic) Unemployment dropped from 12.8% to 6.8% between 2020 and 2024 104,000 jobs created in four years Venezuelan migrant workers (28,000 by 2021) are disproportionately in informal sectors with very low wages The honest take: Guyana\u0026rsquo;s economy is growing faster than almost anywhere on earth. But growth hasn\u0026rsquo;t reached everyone equally. The cash grants, housing subsidies, and education investments are meant to bridge that gap. Whether they\u0026rsquo;re enough is a legitimate debate — but pretending nothing is happening is dishonest.\n💡 PATRIOT\u0026rsquo;S WEEKLY INVESTMENT TIPS For the SMALL SAVER ($50,000-$500,000): Open a savings account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one. The banking sector is expanding — GBTI just launched private banking, but regular services are also improving Apply for GOAL scholarship — $5.8 billion allocated, 10,805 awarded last year. Free education = higher earning power Use the cash grant wisely — $100,000 can be seed capital for a small business, not just consumption For the GROWING INVESTOR ($500,000-$5,000,000): Housing — The expanded mortgage ceiling means you can buy more house for less down payment. Property values near development corridors (East Bank, East Coast) are rising Small business — Tourism-adjacent services have the most immediate opportunity Agriculture — Government pushing science-driven, climate-smart farming. Agri-processing has export potential For the SERIOUS INVESTOR ($5M+): Gold sector — Legal, compliant operations positioned to benefit from sector cleanup Real estate — Hotel boom continues, but commercial property near new infrastructure is the smart play Technology — Caribbean Tech Alliance linking Guyana and Jamaica. Digital services sector emerging 📊 THIS WEEK\u0026rsquo;S PORTFOLIO SCORECARD Sector Outlook Signal Oil \u0026amp; Gas 🟢 G2E project $10.7B allocated Gold Mining 🟢 Crackdown benefits legal operators Tourism 🟢🟢 17.2% growth, record projections Housing 🟢🟢 Expanded mortgages + $7.5B subsidy Education 🟢 Massive allocations, UG tuition-free Agriculture 🟡 Steady, climate adaptation focus Infrastructure 🟢 Road projects continue (with traffic) 📌 BOTTOM LINE Budget 2026 is the biggest ever. The opposition says it has \u0026ldquo;nothing for the people.\u0026rdquo; The government says it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;transformational.\u0026rdquo; The truth, as usual, is somewhere in the middle. The ALLOCATIONS are there — cash grants, housing, education, healthcare. The QUESTION is whether the money reaches the right people efficiently and whether the economic growth translates into opportunities you can actually access.\nYour job as a Patriot is not to wait for the government OR the opposition to build your wealth. Use every programme, every grant, every opportunity available. Get your documents in order. Formalize your hustle. Invest in education. And keep reading the Portfolio.\nUntil next Friday — build wealth, not arguments! 🇬🇾💪\nPatriots Portfolio is a fictional satirical column providing general economic commentary and entertainment. This is not professional financial advice. Consult a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-06-patriots-portfolio/","summary":"This week\u0026rsquo;s Patriots Portfolio breaks down the biggest budget stories: the $1.588 trillion allocation, tourism boom, gold sector resurrection, cash grants debate, and what it all means for ordinary Guyanese trying to build wealth in the fastest-growing economy in the world.","title":"Patriots Portfolio: Budget 2026 Deep Dive — Where Is the $1.588 Trillion Actually Going?"},{"content":"🇬🇾 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S TAKE 🇬🇾 Your Uncle from the Diaspora Who Actually Reads Past the Headlines\nGreetings from Queens, where it cold like ice but my blood pressure hot from reading the nonsense the opposition talking in Parliament this week! Pull up a chair and leh me explain what really happening in Guyana.\n🪖 PRESIDENT ALI AT THE GDF CONFERENCE — THIS IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE You know what impressed me? The President didn\u0026rsquo;t just talk tough about Venezuela. He told the GDF to think BIGGER — beyond the battlefield. Cybersecurity. Environmental protection. Technology infrastructure. Undersea cables. The man is building a modern defence force, not just a garrison.\nAnd let me tell you something the Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough — the GDF is getting NEW BOATS arriving end of this month, expanding drone operations, and the Brigadier himself said border defence is \u0026ldquo;non-negotiable.\u0026rdquo; This is a government that\u0026rsquo;s investing in security, not just talking about it.\nWhen APNU was in power, what did they do for the GDF? Give them expired rations and broken trucks? President Ali is modernizing the entire force while keeping the diplomatic channels open. THAT is how a small country navigates big threats.\n💰 THE BUDGET DEBATE: OPPOSITION HAS NO PLAN, JUST COMPLAINTS Four days of debate and not ONE alternative budget from the opposition. Not one. They come to Parliament, complain about everything, and offer what exactly? Dr. Mahadeo was right — \u0026ldquo;come here informed!\u0026rdquo;\nLet me give you the facts they conveniently ignore:\nTelemedicine sites: From 4 in 2022 to 130 now. That\u0026rsquo;s a 3,150% increase! Heart surgeries: Over 100 in 2025, up from about 20 before 2019 Medical drones: Being tested for hinterland deliveries Unemployment: Cut by MORE THAN HALF — from 12.8% to 6.8% Jobs created: 104,000 between 2020 and 2024 And Minister Teixeira put it perfectly — this country has done a trajectory \u0026ldquo;never seen before\u0026rdquo; in all its years of independence. We celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and for the FIRST TIME Guyanese can feel genuine national pride about where the economy is heading.\n✈️ TOURISM BOOMING — 34,923 VISITORS IN JANUARY ALONE The Brief made jokes about tourism. Let me give you the REAL story. January 2026 saw a 17.2% increase in visitor arrivals. The GTA projects 550,000 by year end — up from 453,489 in 2025, which was ALREADY a record year.\nAnd the government is smart about it — removing residency requirements for destination weddings, cutting vehicle costs for hinterland transport, eliminating all import duties on ATVs. They\u0026rsquo;re building the infrastructure for a tourism INDUSTRY, not just hoping people show up.\nThe US, Caribbean, and Latin America are the top source markets. Guyana is becoming a BRAND. And that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen by accident — it happens because a government has a strategy and executes it.\n🏗️ WHAT THE BRIEF MISSED The Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t mention these important stories:\n$6 Billion for Sports Development — The Cricket Board praised the budget allocation. Six Guyanese players selected for West Indies T20 World Cup squad! Two in the U-19 team for the Youth World Cup! Guyana is becoming a sporting powerhouse.\nCPL 2026 Finals Tickets on Sale TODAY — Republic Bank CPL finals going on general sale. Guyana hosting, Guyana winning, Guyana GROWING.\nGuyana Digital School expanding — The outreach programme is visiting schools across the country. This is how you build a modern education system — not by complaining in Parliament, but by going to the schools and registering students one by one.\nDavid Dabydeen Nominated for Nobel Prize — A Guyanese writer nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature! This is the kind of international recognition that makes every Guyanese proud, no matter which party you support.\n🤔 A WORD ABOUT THE \u0026ldquo;GHOST GRANT\u0026rdquo; STORY Kaieteur running stories about 30,000 \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; cash grant recipients. Let me explain something simple. Population figures get UPDATED. Registration drives capture people who then move, pass away, or don\u0026rsquo;t qualify for various reasons. The difference between $63 billion and $60 billion could be explained by a dozen administrative factors. But no — Kaieteur wants to turn basic budget adjustment into an election conspiracy.\nYou know what ISN\u0026rsquo;T a conspiracy? 600,000 Guyanese adults receiving $100,000 each. SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS going directly into household pockets. Show me another country in the Caribbean doing that. I\u0026rsquo;ll wait.\n📋 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S FRIDAY VERDICT Topic Rating Why GDF modernization ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Real investment, real equipment, real strategy Budget provisions ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ $1.588 trillion working for the people Tourism growth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Record numbers, smart policies Opposition performance ⭐ Four days, zero alternatives Cricket success ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Six players in WI T20 World Cup squad!

Maybe? The Drama:\nPM Mottley has been slashing Ralph Thorne over an interview he gave to Trinidad media. Early voting is already underway. Schools will be closed on election day.\nThe Reality:\nPolitical analyst Peter Wickham summed it up: \u0026ldquo;The conversation we are having these days is whether the opposition can actually gain a seat or two.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the bar. Not winning. Not being competitive. Just\u0026hellip; existing in Parliament.\nPrediction: Mottley wins big. Again.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $415 MILLION IMF EMERGENCY CASH The Bailout:\nThe IMF Executive Board has approved Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s request for emergency financial assistance of approximately US$415 million.\nWhy:\nJamaica is facing urgent balance-of-payments needs. The details are still emerging, but this is significant emergency support from the Fund.\nThe Context:\nJamaica has been on an economic reform trajectory for years, but external shocks continue to test resilience. This injection provides breathing room.\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: PM KAMLA DOUBLES DOWN ON CARICOM CRITICISM The Rift:\nTrinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar used Parliament on Friday to call for major transformation within CARICOM.\nHer Position:\nThe PM has been vocal about the regional body\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness (or lack thereof), questioning whether CARICOM is actually delivering for member states.\nThe Pattern:\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t new. Trinidad has often been the loudest voice questioning regional integration while simultaneously benefiting from it.\nCARICOM Response:\nThe regional body is focused on other fires — namely Haiti.\n🇭🇹 CARICOM REBUKES HAITI LEADERSHIP The Crisis:\nIn a rare and sharply worded rebuke, Caribbean leaders have placed Haiti\u0026rsquo;s transitional leadership under renewed regional scrutiny.\nThe Target:\nEfforts are underway to remove caretaker Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils Aimé amid deepening instability.\nThe Numbers:\n1.4 million internally displaced Gang violence escalating Elections postponed to August/December 2026 Transitional Presidential Council mandate expires February 7th The Reality:\nHaiti remains in freefall, and the region is running out of patience with transitional arrangements that produce no transitions.\n🛂 US VISA CRACKDOWN HITS CARIBBEAN The Squeeze:\nThe United States is tightening visa scrutiny across the Caribbean as part of a crackdown on birth tourism and citizenship-by-investment concerns.\nCountries Affected:\nBarbados Trinidad and Tobago Jamaica Antigua and Barbuda (partial travel restrictions) Dominica Grenada What\u0026rsquo;s Happening:\nMore rigorous visa interviews Questions about travel intent Pregnant applicants face extra scrutiny Processing delays expected For Antigua \u0026amp; Barbuda:\nBeginning January 2026, partial travel restrictions tied to security vetting and CBI programme concerns are in effect.\nThe Message:\nUsing a tourist visa for maternity care in the US will likely result in denial. Washington is watching.\n✈️ CARIBBEAN TOURISM TAKES A HIT The Decline:\nAfter 12 consecutive months of growth, several Caribbean destinations saw significant declines in U.S. tourist arrivals in 2025:\nBarbados Cuba Jamaica Saint Lucia Bermuda Aruba The Causes:\nEconomic pressures and inflation Rising cost of international travel Competition from other destinations Shifting travel patterns post-pandemic The Response:\nIslands are focusing on diversifying offerings and adapting to new travel trends. But recovery isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed.\n🏆 BAJAN STUDENTS WIN REGIONAL AI STOCK GAME The Victory:\nBarbados has dethroned four-time defending champions Trinidad and Tobago to claim the Caribbean Title Trophy in an AI-driven virtual stock market game.\nThe Numbers:\nBarbadian students completed:\n128,960 trades on the Jamaica Stock Exchange 27,379 trades on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange The Significance:\nEducation Minister noted this reflects Barbados\u0026rsquo;s broader reform agenda to equip students with 21st-century skills.\nOne Winner\u0026rsquo;s Strategy:\n\u0026ldquo;I really focused on the Jamaican markets\u0026hellip; basically buying and selling Trinidad and Jamaican stocks daily.\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: Bajan kids beat Trini kids at their own stock market game.

No car. No security. Just vibes and an indictment.\nMeanwhile, gold is over $5,000 an ounce but apparently we can\u0026rsquo;t find it, Speaker Nadir is still limiting journalists to a handful, and the government is promising to fix Stabroek Market — finally!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive in. 🇬🇾\n💀 THE TRAGEDY: Four Men Dead on Cargo Vessel at Water Street What Happened:\nFour men are dead after what appears to be a gas inhalation incident aboard a cargo vessel docked at the Courtney Benn Wharf on Water Street, Georgetown.\nThe deceased:\nBrandon Deonarine, 18 — Seaman, Support, EBD Nerwaine Persaud, 57 — Boat Captain, Cummings Lodge, ECD Dominic Alexis, 33 — Seaman, De Kinderen, WCD Getindra Sanchara, 25 — Engineer, Cummings Lodge, ECD Police report that the men were inspecting a dry space within the engine room in the lower section of the vessel when they were overcome by fumes from what\u0026rsquo;s believed to be a gas tank.\nGovernment Response:\nThe Ministry of Labour has dispatched Occupational Health and Safety Officers to investigate.\nThe Bigger Picture:\nThis is exactly the kind of workplace tragedy that should never happen. An 18-year-old and a 57-year-old — a whole generation apart — both lost their lives in the same incident. Questions will need answers: Were proper safety protocols in place? Was there adequate ventilation? Were gas detectors present?\nFour families now have empty chairs at the dinner table.\n⚖️ MOHAMEDS LOSE EXTRADITION CHALLENGE The Ruling:\nActing Chief Justice Navindra Singh has dismissed the constitutional challenge brought by Nazar Mohamed and his son Azruddin Mohamed (yes, THAT Azruddin — your new Opposition Leader) against U.S. extradition proceedings.\nWhat They Argued:\nThe Mohameds claimed:\nMinister of Home Affairs Oneidge Walrond acted with political bias The Authority to Proceed (ATP) was issued unlawfully Natural justice was breached What the Court Said:\nIn a 14-page decision, the Chief Justice ruled that Minister Walrond exercised a lawful executive function in accordance with the Fugitive Offenders Act. No bias. No breach. No problem (for the government, anyway).\nWhat This Means:\nThe extradition proceedings continue. The Mohameds\u0026rsquo; legal team will likely appeal, but for now, the U.S. case against them remains very much alive.\nReminder: U.S. prosecutors allege the Mohameds conspired to commit fraud and launder money through their gold exporting firm, Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise.\n🚗 NO CAR, NO SECURITY FOR OPPOSITION LEADER Gail Teixeira Says:\nMinister of Parliamentary Affairs Gail Teixeira has confirmed that Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed will receive no personal security detail and no government vehicle.\nThe Reasoning:\nAccording to Teixeira, these provisions are not legally mandated. The Constitution guarantees the Opposition Leader a salary and certain privileges — but apparently a car and bodyguards aren\u0026rsquo;t among them.\nThe Irony:\nThe Opposition Leader is literally an \u0026ldquo;international fugitive\u0026rdquo; (Speaker Nadir\u0026rsquo;s words, not ours) wanted by the United States\u0026hellip; and he\u0026rsquo;s walking around without security?\nMake it make sense.\nWhat WIN Says:\nSources indicate Mohamed promised during the campaign that he would refuse his salary. Turns out, he quietly assigned a party member to collect it in cash on his behalf.\nSo\u0026hellip; no to the salary publicly, yes to the cash privately?\n🛒 $2 BILLION TO FIX STABROEK AND BOURDA MARKETS Finally!\nMinister within the Ministry of Local Government Pauline Sukhai announced that Budget 2026 includes $2 billion to begin reconstruction of Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s two most iconic commercial centres:\nMarket Status Budget Stabroek Market Reconstruction begins Part of $2B Bourda Market Reconstruction begins Part of $2B What Sukhai Said:\n\u0026ldquo;This investment reflects the government\u0026rsquo;s broader vision to create a safer, more modern, and culturally vibrant city.\u0026rdquo;\nReality Check:\nThese markets have been \u0026ldquo;about to be fixed\u0026rdquo; for approximately\u0026hellip; forever. If this actually happens, it would be transformational for downtown Georgetown. But we\u0026rsquo;ve heard promises before.\nAlso Announced:\nMunicipalities receiving $50 million in 2025 NDCs receiving $30 million for community projects $7.9 billion for solid waste management 🥇 GOLD AT $5,000/OUNCE — BUT WHERE IS IT?

Are miners declaring everything?\nThe Crackdown:\nPresident Ali has ordered:\nAll registered dredges with no declarations to be deregistered Foreign miners operating illegally to be identified, prosecuted, and expelled Brazilian miners with low or no declarations under investigation He\u0026rsquo;ll be in Region Seven on Friday to meet with small-scale miners directly.\n📰 SPEAKER NADIR\u0026rsquo;S WAR ON PRESS CONTINUES The Situation:\nMedia outlets remain furious after Speaker Manzoor Nadir restricted journalist access to Parliament during budget debates — limiting coverage to just five journalists total and banning TV news cameras.\nThe Guyana Press Association:\nThe GPA has rejected claims by Nadir that there\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;existing agreement\u0026rdquo; on media access, calling his assertions false.\nKaieteur\u0026rsquo;s Take:\nColumnist GHK Lall calls it an \u0026ldquo;undeclared war on parliamentary democracy,\u0026rdquo; noting that Nadir has now crossed two Rubicons: first limiting coverage of the Opposition Leader selection, now limiting budget debate coverage.\nThe Question:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re passing a $1.558 trillion budget — the largest in history — why would you want FEWER people watching?\n🏟️ BAYROC STADIUM OPENS SATURDAY The Event:\nLinden\u0026rsquo;s new Bayroc National Stadium officially opens on Saturday, February 7th at 6:00 PM.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Happening:\nAthletics championship Football match: Georgetown vs. Linden Pre-Mashramani concert featuring Samuel Medas and Diana Chapman The Vision:\nThe Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport says this is one of five regional stadiums under construction, all expected to open in 2026.

Me nephew does write that Daily Brief thing and sometimes he too cynical for he own good. Let me tell you what REALLY happening in Guyana right now.\nBecause while people busy complaining, this government BUILDING.\n💻 DIGITISATION: THIS IS REAL PROGRESS Minister Zulfikar Ally just outlined the most ambitious digital transformation I\u0026rsquo;ve seen from any Caribbean government:\nSkills Connect App — Linking workers directly with employers. No more middleman. No more \u0026ldquo;who you know\u0026rdquo; politics.\nCitizen Connect (launching soon) — You can report issues, give feedback, get real-time updates. Government accountability at your fingertips.\nDigital Appointments — Schedule meetings with ministries online. No more lining up from 5 AM.\nThe Minister said it perfectly: \u0026ldquo;A government that manages billions can no longer rely on paper files and disconnected systems.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he\u0026rsquo;s right! You cyah run a 21st-century economy with 20th-century systems. The opposition still talking about the past while the PPP building the future.\n🏠 HOUSING: THE NUMBERS DON\u0026rsquo;T LIE Minister Colin Croal laid it out clear: Region Four has 52,142 pending housing applicants. That\u0026rsquo;s not bias — that\u0026rsquo;s MATH.\nWhen people say the government showing favouritism, check the actual data:\nRegion 10: 2,315 allocations Region 4: Largest backlog in the country The Minister called it \u0026ldquo;real performance, not theatrics.\u0026rdquo; And he\u0026rsquo;s right. The opposition broke the housing sector from 2015-2020. Now the PPP cleaning up the mess AND building new.\n📈 GDP GROWTH IS PRODUCTION, NOT SPENDING President Ali schooled the critics on basic economics, and me heart was warm.\nHe said: \u0026ldquo;GDP measures production, not payment. If non-oil GDP is growing, it is because businesses are producing more, not because government is spending more.\u0026rdquo;\nFACTS.\nConstruction up. Manufacturing up. Agriculture up. Services up. Transport up. Trade up.\nThe critics calling it \u0026ldquo;government spending\u0026rdquo; because they don\u0026rsquo;t understand macroeconomics.

So they focus on personality attacks, procedural complaints, and pretending the Mohameds are victims instead of facing serious charges.\nPresident Ali said it: \u0026ldquo;We are not managing the present.

The bar is underground. Susan Rodrigues (Tourism) PPP delivered 53,000 house lots, 46% to single women Also announced Guyana hosting CTO conference in October. Tourism budget speech turned housing speech. Sarah Browne (Amerindian Affairs) Told Dawn Hastings she \u0026ldquo;sat quiet as a mouse\u0026rdquo; for 5 years Browne came with RECEIPTS from the coalition era Zulfikar Mustapha (Agriculture) Held up a physical five-year GuySuCo plan Actual prop comedy in Parliament Lenox Shuman (Government MP) Slammed opposition\u0026rsquo;s record on Indigenous development An Amerindian MP defending the PPP — that\u0026rsquo;s 2026 for you The Opposition fired back:\nMP Argument Translation Sharma Solomon (APNU) Extractive regions face \u0026ldquo;structural neglect\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;abject poverty\u0026rdquo; Gold and oil come OUT of your region but the money doesn\u0026rsquo;t come BACK Dawn Hastings (WIN) Hinterland airstrips deteriorating, electricity unreliable Got absolutely torched by Browne in response Vishnu Panday (WIN) Former GuySuCo Estate Manager demands accountability for billions The man literally WORKED in sugar. He has receipts too. Gordon Barker (WIN) $183.6B education allocation but where are the results? Shadow Education Minister\u0026rsquo;s maiden speech Coretta McDonald (APNU/GTU President) Education spending only 2% of total budget Government says you\u0026rsquo;re building schools. Teachers say the schools are falling apart. 📊 THE GUYSUCO SHOWDOWN This one deserves its own section because it was genuinely entertaining.\nGovernment says: Sugar production UP 26.4% — from 47,108 tonnes (2024) to 59,600 tonnes (2025). Five-year plan will return GuySuCo to profitability by 2030. Budget allocates $13.4 billion. Skeldon\u0026rsquo;s 5,000 hectares finally being planted.\nOpposition says: You\u0026rsquo;ve been pouring BILLIONS into this industry for years. Where\u0026rsquo;s the profitability? Where\u0026rsquo;s the accountability? Former estate manager Vishnu Panday called it a \u0026ldquo;devastated\u0026rdquo; industry.\nReality check: Minister Mustapha literally held up a document in Parliament like it was the Ten Commandments. The five-year plan includes 3,000 hectares for mechanised harvesting, three new boilers, and five new harvesters. Whether GuySuCo actually makes money by 2030 is another question entirely.\n🔒 SPEAKER NADIR\u0026rsquo;S MEDIA LOCKOUT: NOW IT\u0026rsquo;S AN EDITORIAL Stabroek News didn\u0026rsquo;t just report on the media restrictions — they wrote a full editorial calling it an \u0026ldquo;unvarnished assault on press freedom.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown:\nIssue Details Journalists allowed in Only 5 at a time (down from 17 in past years) ID confiscation Reporters must surrender national ID cards for temporary badges Broadcasting monopoly Only DPI (government\u0026rsquo;s media arm) can broadcast proceedings Speaker\u0026rsquo;s defence Claims it\u0026rsquo;s based on COVID-era agreements with the GPA GPA\u0026rsquo;s response Those agreements explicitly said \u0026ldquo;media will NOT be restricted\u0026rdquo; and were COVID-specific Kaieteur editorial Called it a \u0026ldquo;war on the press\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;must be stopped\u0026rdquo; The Guyana Press Association called it a \u0026ldquo;direct attack on freedom of the press.\u0026rdquo; The Arthur Chung Convention Centre has MORE space than the old Parliament building, yet FEWER journalists are allowed.\nSpeaker Nadir is essentially arguing that the pandemic rules from 2020 — when people were genuinely afraid of dying from a handshake — should apply in 2026. In a bigger building. With no pandemic.\nMake it make sense.\n💰 OIL FUND WATCH: US$2.8 BILLION INCOMING (AND PROBABLY OUTGOING) GHK Lall\u0026rsquo;s column in Kaieteur News lays it out: the Natural Resource Fund expects approximately US$2.8 billion in deposits this year from royalties and profit oil.\nHis argument? It\u0026rsquo;ll be gone as fast as it comes, just like every other year. The column describes the government\u0026rsquo;s approach to the Oil Fund as an \u0026ldquo;addiction to draining\u0026rdquo; and notes there\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;no accounting\u0026rdquo; for how extracted funds are spent.\nMeanwhile, Bharrat told Parliament that oil production is now over 900,000 barrels per day — an extraordinary rate for a country that only started producing in 2019.\n🌿 9 MILLION CARBON CREDITS: GUYANA GOES GREEN (ON PAPER) The government announced that ART issued 9,085,923 TREES carbon credits for 2023, now labelled CORSIA-eligible — meaning airlines can use them to offset emissions.\nThis is Guyana\u0026rsquo;s third consecutive year earning carbon credits since 2021 under the LCDS. The credits meet the highest international standards for environmental integrity.\nAmerindian connection: Minister Browne told Parliament that $14.5 billion from carbon credit revenues has been directly disbursed to Amerindian villages. Fifteen percent went to villages in 2023, 26.5% in 2024, and 21% in 2025.\n🇵🇦 PANAMA OPENING EMBASSY IN GUYANA President Ali met with Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino during a stop in Panama City after his Belize state visit. Key outcomes: Panama will open an embassy in Georgetown, joined the Global Biodiversity Alliance as a founding member, and both countries agreed to collaborate on oil and gas, logistics, agriculture, and security.\nAli continues his regional diplomatic tour like he\u0026rsquo;s collecting country stamps in a passport.\n📚 EDUCATION DEBATE: \u0026ldquo;FLUFF BUDGET\u0026rdquo; VS \u0026ldquo;FUTURE INVESTMENT\u0026rdquo; The education sector debate got spicy:\nOpposition says: GTU President Coretta McDonald argues education gets only about 2% of central government expenditure — not real prioritisation despite absolute numbers going up. Shadow Minister Gordon Barker questioned whether the $183.6 billion allocation addresses actual operational challenges.\nGovernment says: Minister Parag defended GOAL scholarships (pointed out one WIN MP actually BENEFITED from GOAL while criticising it), touted 66 new nursery schools, 34 primary schools, and 33 secondary schools built since 2020, and referenced the $7 billion school feeding programme.\nParag\u0026rsquo;s best line was essentially: \u0026ldquo;You criticised GOAL, but your own MP used GOAL to get his degree.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;never bite the hand that feeds you\u0026rdquo; headline basically wrote itself.\n🏥 DR. BALWANT SINGH HOSPITAL GOES DIGITAL The first private hospital in Guyana to launch a patient portal app — patients can book appointments, view medical records, access test results, and manage prescriptions online. CEO Dr. Madhu Singh calls it a major step for healthcare accessibility.\nGeorgetown in 2026: you can check your blood work on your phone but the road outside the hospital still has potholes from 2019.\n⚡ ANOTHER ELECTROCUTION: ESSEQUIBO COAST Toolsie Ram Singh, 63, died after the boom of his Hiab truck contacted overhead power lines while loading logs at Barakat Dam, Essequibo Coast. This is the SECOND fatal Hiab incident near GPL infrastructure in two weeks — the first was on January 26 in Kitty.\nGPL is pleading with contractors to get proper permissions before working near power lines. Apparently, this message hasn\u0026rsquo;t reached everyone.\n🔫 RUPUNUNI UPDATE: ARRESTS IN LEON BAIRD MURDER Several persons have been arrested in connection with the murder of Rupununi tour guide Leon \u0026ldquo;Rasta\u0026rdquo; Baird, whose partially burnt body was found on January 25. His brother told Stabroek News that Leon had been threatened multiple times before his killing, raising concerns about cattle rustling and border security in Region 9.\nAlso in Region 9: police discovered a shotgun and ammunition in Hiawa Village — a 31-year-old teacher was arrested for unlicensed possession.\n🚗 GEORGETOWN PARKING CRACKDOWN Four vehicles clamped on Camp Street near Church Street. Police have been increasingly aggressive with wheel clamps around Robb and Camp streets since December. One vehicle was reportedly clamped moments after parking.\nThe message is clear: Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s parking enforcement has exactly two speeds — completely absent, and instant karma.\n🏏 T20 WORLD CUP STARTS FRIDAY!

Alexaudria Chasles scored SIX goals. Eight different players found the net.\nDespite the dominant finish, Guyana exited the tournament — only group winners and the two best second-place teams advance. Jamaica won the group. But 14-0 is 14-0. Remember these names.\n🌐 ICANN COMES TO GUYANA The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers held its first-ever \u0026ldquo;ICANN Near You\u0026rdquo; conference at UG\u0026rsquo;s Turkeyen campus. The three-day event (Feb 3-5) focuses on internet governance and cyber resilience. UG Vice-Chancellor Professor Paloma Mohamed Martin noted that universities, including UG, increasingly face phishing attacks, impersonation, and system intrusions.\n🌍 QUICK HITS Commonwealth Law Ministers Meeting in Fiji next week (Feb 9-12) — Guyana attending Guyana Development Bank getting US$100M for interest-free loans, no collateral required for farmers — $3M max per loan Ali\u0026rsquo;s unemployment claim: 12.8% → 6.8% (2020 to Q4 2024).

Ninety-three candidates across four main parties are contesting 30 seats in what could be the most competitive Barbados election in years.\nParty Candidates Leader Notes Barbados Labour Party (BLP) 30 PM Mia Mottley Going for third straight term. Won 30-0 in both 2018 and 2022 Democratic Labour Party (DLP) 30 Ralph Thorne Trying to claw back from two consecutive shutouts Friends of Democracy (FOD) 11-12 New party Pledging tax relief for seniors, penalties for late government payments People\u0026rsquo;s Coalition for Progress (PCP) 15 Alliance (NNP+UPP+CBLP) First coalition attempt by smaller parties Reform Barbados TBD New Making debut On the ground: Barbados Today reports voters in St. Philip say most candidates are \u0026ldquo;invisible\u0026rdquo; despite the crowded ballot. One 76-year-old voter said no politician has ever done anything for her — \u0026ldquo;not even a biscuit.\u0026rdquo;\nPollster Peter Wickham explains St. Philip has become a battleground because it\u0026rsquo;s traditionally DLP country, and other parties see opportunities there. But he doubts third parties will make real inroads.\nThe big question: Can ANYONE break Mottley\u0026rsquo;s grip? Two consecutive 30-0 sweeps is unprecedented. Even if the DLP wins a handful of seats, it would count as progress.\nFinal voter register drops February 7. Four days later, Barbados decides.\n🏏 T20 WORLD CUP: WEST INDIES READY (THEY SAY) The ICC Men\u0026rsquo;s T20 World Cup starts Friday, February 7 in India and Sri Lanka. West Indies are in Group C with England, Scotland, Nepal, and debutants Italy.\nWest Indies Schedule:\nDate Opponent Venue Feb 7 Scotland Kolkata Feb 11 England Mumbai Feb 15 Nepal Mumbai Feb 19 Italy Kolkata The Squad: Captain Shai Hope leads a team built on power hitting. Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, and Brandon King bring the muscle. Jason Holder provides experience and death bowling. Gudakesh Motie returns after fixing his bowling action — his left-arm spin could be crucial on subcontinental pitches.\nHead Coach Daren Sammy, who captained the 2012 and 2016 title-winning teams, says the squad has \u0026ldquo;balance, extensive experience, and a touch of mystery.\u0026rdquo; He believes \u0026ldquo;something special is about to happen.\u0026rdquo;\nThe concern: West Indies have won only 14 of 43 T20Is since the 2024 World Cup — a 0.52 win-loss ratio. They lost recent series to Afghanistan (2-1), New Zealand (3-1), and South Africa (2-1). But Sammy sees parallels with his 2016 champions.\nBig tournament note: Pakistan are boycotting their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo. They\u0026rsquo;re still playing in the tournament but will forfeit that fixture.\n🇺🇸 US MILITARY IN THE CARIBBEAN: STILL DIVIDING THE REGION Operation Southern Spear continues, and Caribbean nations remain split on how to respond.\nBarbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds has expressed concern that US strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels \u0026ldquo;may have bypassed due process\u0026rdquo; and risk setting a dangerous precedent.\nTrinidad PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar says \u0026ldquo;no international law was breached\u0026rdquo; by T\u0026amp;T\u0026rsquo;s cooperation with the US on regional anti-drug operations.\nUS Senator Jack Reed (Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee) has condemned the strikes, aligning with Caribbean voices questioning the legal basis.\nAmnesty International warns that any airstrikes authorised by Congress would violate international human rights law and could amount to unlawful executions.\nThe Caribbean remains caught between its largest trading partner\u0026rsquo;s military ambitions and its own sovereignty concerns.

CCTV footage showed officers firing on a man with his hands up, triggering widespread outrage.\nTeachers staged mass sick calls disrupting classes across T\u0026amp;T in an apparently coordinated protest over working conditions. The education system is straining.\nOn the diplomatic front, the Trump administration has \u0026ldquo;reaffirmed the strength of its partnership\u0026rdquo; with PM Persad-Bissessar\u0026rsquo;s government — positioning Trinidad as a US ally in the region while tensions with Venezuela simmer.\n⚖️ CCJ PRESIDENT VISITS BARBADOS Justice Winston Anderson, President of the Caribbean Court of Justice, and Registrar Gabrielle Figaro-Jones are paying an official visit to Barbados.

Welcome to The Guyana Brief for Wednesday, February 4th, 2026. Parliament is on FIRE — not literally, but close. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\n[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET DAY 2]\nBudget Debate Day Two was absolute chaos. On the government side, Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat says Guyana\u0026rsquo;s oil sector is one of the best managed among new producers worldwide. Production? Over 900,000 barrels per day. He also touted a \u0026lsquo;resurrection\u0026rsquo; of the gold mining sector with over 1,000 small miners getting land access.\nTourism Minister Susan Rodrigues came with the housing numbers — 53,000 house lots since 2020, 46 percent going to single women. Then she turned to opposition MP Sherod Duncan and reminded everyone his OWN government fired him over audit report issues. That was PERSONAL.\nThe BIGGEST moment? Agriculture Minister Mustapha literally held up a five-year plan for GuySuCo — like a physical document, in Parliament — and said sugar will be profitable by 2030. Production already up 26 percent. Three thousand hectares going mechanical. New boilers, new harvesters, the works.\nBut the opposition wasn\u0026rsquo;t quiet. Former GuySuCo estate manager Vishnu Panday called the industry \u0026lsquo;devastated\u0026rsquo; and wants accountability for billions already spent. APNU\u0026rsquo;s Sharma Solomon painted a picture of mining regions in \u0026lsquo;structural neglect\u0026rsquo; — gold and oil coming OUT of the hinterland but prosperity not going BACK.\nAnd in a fierce exchange, Amerindian Affairs Minister Sarah Browne absolutely TORCHED opposition MP Dawn Hastings. She said Hastings sat \u0026lsquo;quiet as a mouse\u0026rsquo; for five years while the coalition sent home 2,000 Community Service Officers and ignored Indigenous land issues. That was BRUTAL.\n[SEGMENT 2: MEDIA LOCKOUT]\nNow, the story EVERYBODY is talking about — Speaker Nadir\u0026rsquo;s media restrictions.\nOnly FIVE journalists allowed inside Parliament at any time. Reporters must surrender their national ID cards for temporary badges. And ONLY the government\u0026rsquo;s Department of Public Information can broadcast proceedings.\nStabroek News wrote an entire editorial calling it an \u0026lsquo;unvarnished assault on press freedom.\u0026rsquo; Kaieteur News says Nadir\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;war on the press must be stopped.\u0026rsquo; The Guyana Press Association called it a \u0026lsquo;direct attack on freedom of the press.\u0026rsquo;\nNadir\u0026rsquo;s defence? He says it\u0026rsquo;s based on COVID-era agreements from 2020. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing — the Arthur Chung Convention Centre has MORE space than the old Parliament building. And the GPA says those agreements explicitly stated media would NOT be restricted. They were COVID-specific.\nSo why limit journalists in 2026, in a BIGGER venue, with no pandemic? That\u0026rsquo;s the question nobody can answer.\n[SEGMENT 3: DIPLOMACY AND GREEN WINS]\nOn a brighter note — President Ali stopped in Panama after his Belize visit and secured a commitment from Panama to open an embassy in Georgetown. Panama also joined the Global Biodiversity Alliance.\nAnd the government announced 9 million carbon credits for 2023 — CORSIA-eligible, meaning airlines worldwide can buy them. Guyana is the ONLY country certified to sell credits to the aviation industry. Third year running.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s real money. And Minister Browne says 14.5 billion dollars has already gone directly to Amerindian villages from carbon credit revenues.\n[SEGMENT 4: SPORTS]\nCricket fans — the T20 World Cup starts FRIDAY! West Indies open against Scotland in Kolkata on February 7th. Shai Hope is captain, Daren Sammy is coaching, and we\u0026rsquo;ve got Hetmyer, Powell, and Holder in the squad. Sammy says \u0026lsquo;something special is about to happen.\u0026rsquo;\nAnd massive respect to the Junior Lady Jags who HAMMERED St. Vincent and the Grenadines 14-0 in their final Concacaf qualifier! Alexaudria Chasles scored SIX goals by herself. Remember that name.\n[SEGMENT 5: LOOKING AHEAD]\nBig week coming up — Budget Debate continues through the week. Barbados goes to the polls on February 11th — 93 candidates, 30 seats, Mottley going for a historic third term.\nAnd keep your eyes on the Oil Fund — it\u0026rsquo;s expected to receive US$2.8 billion this year. The question is how much of that stays in the fund.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Wednesday brief! Full articles on guyanadailybrief.com. For the pro-government take, check Uncle Ramesh.

Across the region, the biggest story continues to be the one floating in your waters — the United States military is still sinking boats, Maduro has been captured and removed from Venezuela, and Caribbean leaders can\u0026rsquo;t agree on whether this is liberation or colonialism with better PR.\nMeanwhile, Barbados has an election in 8 days, Jamaica just got emergency money from the IMF, and CPL ticket sales start this week. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in.\n🚢 OPERATION SOUTHERN SPEAR: THE NUMBERS NOBODY CAN IGNORE Since September 2025, the US military has executed at least 36 strikes on 37 vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 117 people. The campaign — branded \u0026ldquo;Operation Southern Spear\u0026rdquo; — represents the largest US military deployment in the Americas in decades.\n📊 OPERATION SOUTHERN SPEAR — BY THE NUMBERS\nMetric Count Total strikes 36+ Vessels hit 37 People killed 117+ Caribbean Sea strikes 11 Eastern Pacific strikes 24 Survivors taken into custody 4 Evidence publicly presented None The January 3 capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a predawn raid escalated everything. The US had been steadily tightening the noose — seizing oil tankers in December, blockading Venezuelan waters, designating the Maduro regime as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and finally executing what they called \u0026ldquo;Operation Absolute Resolve.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Caribbean Response Is\u0026hellip; Divided:\nTrinidad\u0026rsquo;s PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar offered the US access to Trinidad for operations and was quoted saying the military should deal with drug traffickers \u0026ldquo;violently.\u0026rdquo; Venezuela\u0026rsquo;s response was to call this an act of war.\nBarbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds took the opposite view, expressing concern that the strikes \u0026ldquo;bypassed due process\u0026rdquo; and urged that suspects be \u0026ldquo;arrested, tried, and sentenced\u0026rdquo; — not assassinated at sea.\nCARICOM foreign ministers wrote to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio asking that military operations not be conducted without prior notice. The response from Washington has been, effectively, silence.\nHuman Rights Watch has called the campaign \u0026ldquo;extrajudicial killings\u0026rdquo; with no credible legal basis. Two citizens of Trinidad and Tobago are believed to have been among those killed in an October strike, though neither government has confirmed this.\n🇧🇧 BARBADOS: ELECTION DAY FEBRUARY 11 Barbados heads to the polls in 8 days, and the race is shaping up to be competitive. The Friends of Democracy (FOD) has released its manifesto, pledging tax relief for seniors and penalties for late government payments. Christ Church East Central is emerging as one of the island\u0026rsquo;s most competitive constituencies, with four candidates contesting.\nAviation safety concerns linger after last year\u0026rsquo;s US-related flight cancellations, though normal operations have resumed. Voters across St. Philip say the number of candidates is unprecedented but real issues — cost of living, healthcare, infrastructure — remain the same regardless of who\u0026rsquo;s running.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $415M IMF EMERGENCY LIFELINE The IMF Executive Board approved Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance to meet urgent balance-of-payments needs. This comes as Caribbean economies continue to navigate post-pandemic recovery, rising import costs, and the fallout from global trade disruption.\nPM Andrew Holness, fresh off winning a historic third consecutive term in September\u0026rsquo;s elections, faces the challenge of maintaining fiscal discipline while delivering on campaign promises. Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s gas prices rose again this week — up $0.45 and $0.47 for gasoline, and $2.00 for diesel — reminding voters that election victories don\u0026rsquo;t fill your tank.\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: WALKING A TIGHTROPE Trinidad and Tobago finds itself in the most delicate position in the region. PM Persad-Bissessar\u0026rsquo;s public support for US military operations — including offering the US access to Trinidadian territory — drew Venezuela\u0026rsquo;s ire. Maduro had threatened both Trinidad and Guyana with retaliation before his capture.\nNow, with Maduro removed and US forces firmly established in the southern Caribbean, Trinidad must manage:\nIts energy relationship with Venezuela (interrupted cooperation agreements) Fears about Trinidadian fishermen being caught in US strikes (two TT nationals believed killed in October) The ongoing CPL cricket season and regional tourism that depends on stability CPL 2026 final tickets go on sale February 7 — a reminder that life and sport go on, even when your neighbour\u0026rsquo;s president just got kidnapped.\n🌊 REGIONAL ROUNDUP US Visa Crackdown: Caribbean nationals face stricter US visa scrutiny in 2026 as Washington cracks down on birth tourism. Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, Antigua, Dominica, and Grenada are all affected. Enhanced interviews, deeper travel intent examination, and processing delays are expected.\nGuyana\u0026rsquo;s Ali in Belize: President Ali addressed the Belizean National Assembly, calling for Caribbean food security cooperation and fair regional trade. He and PM Briceño discussed sugar industry partnerships.\nCCJ Leadership Visit: Caribbean Court of Justice President Winston Anderson and Registrar Gabrielle Figaro-Jones are in Trinidad for official engagements — a reminder that the region\u0026rsquo;s judicial independence continues to develop, even as external military powers operate freely in its waters.\nSVG Sailing Week: The countdown to SVG Sailing Week 2026 has officially begun following a media launch in St. Vincent. Tourism operators across the Eastern Caribbean are banking on a strong season.\nSabga Awards: The 2026 Anthony N. Sabga Awards for Caribbean Excellence honoured five individuals — from Barbados, Jamaica, and Guyana — in arts, entrepreneurship, public service, and science. Caribbean excellence persists regardless of geopolitics.\n💭 THE BIGGER PICTURE The Caribbean is living through a moment that will be studied in history books. A major world power has assembled a naval fleet in regional waters, executed lethal strikes killing over 100 people, captured a sitting head of state, and is enforcing a blockade on a sovereign nation — all within Caribbean maritime territory.\nSome CARICOM leaders support it. Some oppose it. Most are trying not to say anything too loudly in either direction. The one thing everyone agrees on is that small island states have almost no leverage when a superpower decides your backyard is its battlefield.\nThe question for the Caribbean isn\u0026rsquo;t whether drug trafficking should be stopped — everyone agrees it should. The question is whether military assassination without evidence, trial, or accountability is the method the region accepts. Because once you accept it for drug boats, the precedent is set for whatever comes next.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Caribbean Brief for Tuesday. Barbados votes in 8 days, Jamaica balances the books, Trinidad balances relationships, and the entire region balances sovereignty against survival. 🌴\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-03-caribbean-brief/","summary":"The US military campaign in Caribbean waters has killed over 117 people, Barbados elections are 8 days away, Jamaica secured $415M in IMF emergency aid, Trinidad\u0026rsquo;s PM praised the boat strikes, and CARICOM can\u0026rsquo;t agree on anything except that things are complicated.","title":"Caribbean Daily Brief — US Warships Still Blowing Up Boats, Barbados Heads to Polls, Jamaica Gets IMF Lifeline, and the Region Wonders What Happened to Sovereignty"},{"content":"Good morning, Guyana! ☕\nWelcome to Tuesday, where the National Assembly sounds like a zoo (literally — animal noises were reported during debate), Speaker Nadir decided five journalists is more than enough to cover a trillion-dollar budget, and President Ali flew to Belize to explain how great Guyana is while his ministers fight for their fiscal lives back home.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s menu: Budget debates open with maximum chaos and minimum press access, WIN and APNU both hate the budget but for completely different reasons, sugar is apparently coming back to life, unemployment is down (says the government), a Guyanese-American wins a major Caribbean award, the Rupununi demands justice for a murdered tour guide, and Kaieteur asks the question nobody in Parliament wants to answer.\nGrab your coffee. This one\u0026rsquo;s a full plate. 🇬🇾\n🏛️ BUDGET DEBATE OPENS: HECKLING, ANIMAL NOISES, AND FIVE JOURNALISTS The Big Picture:\nThe $1.558 trillion Budget 2026 debate kicked off Monday at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre, and within hours it turned into a parliamentary circus — complete with what Stabroek News described as \u0026ldquo;bizarre animal noises\u0026rdquo; from the benches.\nThe First Government Punch:\nMinister of Public Works Juan Edghill led the government charge, calling the budget a \u0026ldquo;social contract of inclusion\u0026rdquo; and boasting about the $227 billion allocated to his ministry. He rattled off the new Bharrat Jagdeo Demerara River Bridge, the Heroes Highway, and new hinterland airstrips like a man reading his own resume at a job interview.\nThe Opposition Response:\nFor the first time in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s parliamentary history, a party that is neither PNC nor PPP opened the debate for the opposition. WIN MP Dr. André Lewis delivered a maiden speech that basically said: you\u0026rsquo;re spending record billions but nobody\u0026rsquo;s life is actually getting better. He argued the budget \u0026ldquo;measures success in ounces, barrels, and billions, but not in people.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, APNU\u0026rsquo;s Vinceroy Jordan went straight for agriculture, calling the budget \u0026ldquo;anti-farmer\u0026rdquo; and questioning how $200 million in capital expenditure could transform the entire livestock industry. His math: 85% of the agriculture budget goes to just two entities — Drainage \u0026amp; Irrigation and GuySuCo.\n📵 SPEAKER NADIR LOCKS OUT THE PRESS What Happened:\nSpeaker Manzoor Nadir revived COVID-era pandemic restrictions and limited media access to FIVE journalists at a time inside the parliamentary Dome. Reporters had to surrender their ID cards to receive one of five media passes.\nThe Reaction:\nKaieteur News didn\u0026rsquo;t hold back, running the headline about an \u0026ldquo;opposition uniting against Nadir\u0026rsquo;s media lockout.\u0026rdquo; Veteran journalists pointed out that the old Parliament Building on Brickdam — a much smaller space — allowed more than five journalists inside. The new billion-dollar Conference Centre somehow has less room for the press than the colonial-era building it replaced.\n📊 PRESS FREEDOM SCORECARD\nVenue Capacity Journalists Allowed Old Parliament (Brickdam) Small 5+ journalists Arthur Chung Centre (New) Massive 5 journalists max Your living room Tiny Unlimited (via livestream) The Speaker\u0026rsquo;s defense? \u0026ldquo;This was merely a continuation of what was obtained in 2020 during the Pandemic.\u0026rdquo; Yes, that pandemic. The one that ended years ago.\n✈️ ALI IN BELIZE: FOOD SECURITY DIPLOMACY While his ministers were fielding fire back in Georgetown, President Ali was in Belize addressing their National Assembly, calling on both countries to lead regional food security efforts. He argued that Caribbean trade barriers are hurting farmers and demanded a \u0026ldquo;fair trade system\u0026rdquo; so regional food can actually move within the region.\nAli told Belize\u0026rsquo;s parliament that small states must \u0026ldquo;reinforce the importance of stable institutions, predictable rules and cooperative approaches to global problem-solving.\u0026rdquo; Noble words from a leader whose own Speaker just locked out the press from observing democracy in action.\nThe Belize trip also produced a sugar cooperation agreement — because nothing says Caribbean solidarity like two countries bonding over an industry that has lost money for decades.\n🥊 BUDGET DEBATE HIGHLIGHTS: THE CLASH CARD 📋 MONDAY\u0026rsquo;S DEBATE CARD\nSpeaker Team Main Argument Dr. André Lewis (WIN) Opposition Oil spending is reckless, gold is leaking across borders, no plan for price drops Juan Edghill (PPP/C) Government Budget is pro-poor, infrastructure is transforming lives Vinceroy Jordan (APNU) Opposition Agriculture budget is a joke, 85% goes to D\u0026amp;I and GuySuCo Sonia Parag (PPP/C) Government Education transformed, opposition had \u0026ldquo;lost years\u0026rdquo; Natasha Singh-Lewis (WIN) Opposition 58% poverty rate, women sleeping on streets, budget is \u0026ldquo;a farce\u0026rdquo; Dr. Vindhya Persaud (PPP/C) Government Gender Equality Seal, 21,000 women trained, $70B direct to beneficiaries Pauline Browne (PPP/C) Government Where was Hastings\u0026rsquo; voice when APNU was in power? The star moment: Minister Persaud and Singh-Lewis clashing over whether Guyana is experiencing \u0026ldquo;transformational progress\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;two-faced governance.\u0026rdquo; Persaud pointed to Guyana\u0026rsquo;s rank of 31st out of 149 on the Global Gender Gap Index. Singh-Lewis pointed to women sleeping on road corners in Bourda Market.\nBoth things can be true at the same time, but Parliament isn\u0026rsquo;t really built for nuance.\n🔍 WIN MP CALLS OUT GOLD SMUGGLING — WHILE PARTY LEADER FACES GOLD-SMUGGLING CHARGES You cannot make this up. WIN MP Dr. André Lewis stood in Parliament and demanded \u0026ldquo;more oversight and transparency in mining\u0026rdquo; while the leader of his own party — Azruddin Mohamed — is fighting extradition to the United States on charges including gold smuggling, wire fraud, money laundering, and importing a Lamborghini.\nThe Chronicle made sure to mention that the Mohamed extradition ruling, which was expected Monday, has been pushed to February 9 and 16.\n🎭 IRONY METER: ████████████ 11/10\n📉 UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN, SAYS ALI — OPPOSITION SAYS PROVE IT President Ali cited Bureau of Statistics data showing unemployment dropped from 12.8% in 2020 to 6.8% in Q4 2024. Female unemployment fell from 14.4% to under 9%.\nThe opposition\u0026rsquo;s position remains: these numbers don\u0026rsquo;t match reality on the ground. Cost of living is still rising, the Guyana dollar sits at GYD210:US$1, and Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial asked the best question of the day: \u0026ldquo;What is your bottom line?\u0026rdquo;\nAs in: forget the budget speeches. What do YOU, the citizen, actually have at the end of the month?\n🏭 GUYSUCO WILL RETURN TO PROFITABILITY — AGAIN Agriculture Minister Mustapha told Parliament that sugar production jumped 26% in 2024 and hit 59,000 tonnes in 2025. Budget 2026 allocates $13.4 billion to sugar.\nGuySuCo returning to profitability has been promised so many times it should have its own loyalty card. But the minister also took shots at former GuySuCo director Vishnu Panday — who is now a WIN MP — calling out \u0026ldquo;colossal failures\u0026rdquo; during his tenure.\n💔 JUSTICE FOR RASTA: RUPUNUNI TOUR GUIDE MURDERED Leon \u0026ldquo;Rasta\u0026rdquo; Baird, 38, a beloved tour guide at Wichabai Ranch in the South Rupununi, was murdered after he stumbled upon cattle rustlers butchering stolen animals. His partially burnt body was found two days after he disappeared on January 23.\nBaird wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a tour guide. He was a vaquero, a senior ranger with the South Rupununi Conservation Society, a co-author of academic biodiversity papers, and the man who taught children on the ranch to ride horses and harvest açaí. His brother is demanding arrests. No one has been charged.\nThe Rupununi Livestock Producers Association and Visit Rupununi have both called for zero tolerance on cattle rustling — a chronic problem that everyone acknowledges and nobody has fixed.\n🏆 QUICK HITS 🧬 Guyanese-American Wins Sabga Award: A Guyanese-American biotech innovator was among five recipients of the 2026 Anthony N.

He reads all four Guyanese newspapers every morning and provides his pro-government perspective on the day\u0026rsquo;s news.\nAright, aright, aright. Leh me start with the Chronicle because today? Today was a GOOD day for this country, and the Brief don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know that.\nTHE BUDGET DEBATE — EDGHILL DID HE THING First of all, Minister Edghill get up there and lay out the facts. $227 BILLION for public works. The Bharrat Jagdeo Bridge — US$260 million, connecting Region Three and Four. The Heroes Highway. New hinterland airstrips. Ferry vessels bringing down cost of living in the interior.\nAnd what the opposition do? Animal noises. ANIMAL NOISES in Parliament! This is the quality of representation we dealing with? The Brief want to make joke about it, but lemme tell you — when you cyaan argue with facts, you make noise. Simple.\nUNEMPLOYMENT DOWN — AND THAT IS FACTS President Ali cite Bureau of Statistics data — unemployment drop from 12.8% to 6.8%. Female unemployment from 14.4% to under 9%. These ain\u0026rsquo;t campaign promises. These are STATISTICS. From the BUREAU OF STATISTICS.\nThe Brief say \u0026ldquo;opposition says prove it.\u0026rdquo; Well, the Bureau of Statistics just proved it! What more you want? You want the President to come to your house and count your neighbours\u0026rsquo; jobs personally?\nThis government diversify the economy. Agriculture, construction, services, tourism, oil and gas — every sector growing. The numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie, even if the opposition wish they did.\nALI IN BELIZE — REGIONAL LEADERSHIP While the opposition was making barnyard sounds in Parliament, President Ali was in Belize addressing their National Assembly like a HEAD OF STATE. He talking about food security, regional trade barriers, Caribbean cooperation.\nThe Brief make some snide remark about the Speaker and press freedom in the same breath. But tell me — which other Caribbean leader get invited to address foreign parliaments? Ali talking to Belize about sugar cooperation, agricultural investment, and small-state strategy. That is LEADERSHIP.\nAnd the sugar cooperation? The Chronicle report that Belize and Guyana moving to deepen ties in the sugar industry. Two countries with sugar history working together. That is smart policy.\nGUYSUCO — THE COMEBACK IS REAL Minister Mustapha say sugar production up 26% in 2024 and hit 59,000 tonnes in 2025. Budget 2026 allocate $13.4 billion.\nThe Brief make joke about \u0026ldquo;profitability loyalty card.\u0026rdquo; But tell me this — who close the sugar estates? APNU. Who fire 7,000 sugar workers? APNU. Who bring back the industry? PPP/C. The numbers speak.\nAnd before anybody forget — the former agriculture director at GuySuCo who oversaw the \u0026ldquo;colossal failures\u0026rdquo;? He now a WIN MP. So when WIN criticize agriculture spending, remember who was running agriculture into the ground.\nTHE GOLD SMUGGLING IRONY Now this? THIS is the story of the day. WIN MP Dr. André Lewis stand up in Parliament — in his MAIDEN speech — and demand mining oversight and transparency. Meanwhile, the LEADER of his party, Azruddin Mohamed, is fighting extradition to Florida on ELEVEN COUNTS including gold smuggling, wire fraud, and money laundering.\nA US$50 million gold-export scheme. A Lamborghini Roadster imported illegally. And this party want to lecture GOVERNMENT about mining transparency?\nThe Chronicle put it perfectly. You cyaan preach about gold oversight when your boss is the one allegedly stealing the gold.\nTHE SABGA AWARD One thing the Brief barely mentioned — a Guyanese-American biotech innovator win a major Caribbean excellence award. This is the kind of thing that shows Guyana producing world-class talent. The PPP/C government investment in education, in GOAL scholarships, in creating opportunity — this is what it produce.\nSpeaking of GOAL — 32 scholars just completed PhD programmes. FREE. Online. Through Texila American University. 27 in management, 5 in public health. Under this government, advanced education becoming accessible.\nON THE PRESS THING The Brief making big noise about Speaker Nadir and the five-journalist limit. Look — I ain\u0026rsquo;t saying I agree with the number. But let me ask this: when APNU was in government and they refuse to hold press conferences for MONTHS, where was the outrage? When David Granger used to cherry-pick which journalist get to ask questions? Nobody wasn\u0026rsquo;t writing editorials then.\nThe budget debate is being LIVESTREAMED. Every Guyanese with a phone can watch. Five journalists in the room plus a camera broadcasting to the entire nation. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a media blackout — it\u0026rsquo;s a logistical arrangement that probably could use adjustment, yes. But comparing it to press oppression? Come on now.\nTHE GENDER EQUALITY SEAL Minister Persaud announce something historic — Guyana introducing a Gender Empowerment and Equality Seal. FIRST IN THE CARIBBEAN. For public and private sector. Safer workplaces, equal opportunities.\nPlus the WIIN programme train 21,000 women. The Because We Care grant at $85,000 per child. Free prostheses costing $1 million each. Free hearing aids.\nThis is what $70 billion direct to beneficiaries look like. But Singh-Lewis from WIN say it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;farce.\u0026rdquo; A farce that putting money in 90,000 pensioners\u0026rsquo; pockets every month.\nBOTTOM LINE The opposition can\u0026rsquo;t decide what they against. WIN say oil spending reckless. APNU say agriculture spending too low. WIN say the budget is disconnected from reality. APNU say give farmers more money. They can\u0026rsquo;t even agree on what to be angry about.\nMeanwhile, this government delivering infrastructure, education, social services, and regional leadership — simultaneously. The budget ain\u0026rsquo;t perfect. No budget ever is. But calling it a \u0026ldquo;farce\u0026rdquo; while your party leader dodging extradition? That is the real farce.\nLeh dem debate.

Stay sharp, Guyana.\n[END CARD: SUBSCRIBE | guyanadailybrief.com]\nEstimated runtime: 55-60 seconds Tone: Energetic, punchy, slightly wry Background: Guyana flag gradient or Parliament exterior\n🎬 SCRIPT 2: 4-MINUTE VERSION (HeyGen Full Brief) [TITLE CARD: GUYANA DAILY BRIEF — TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2026]\n[INTRO — 0:00-0:20]\nGood morning, Guyana! Welcome to the Daily Brief for Tuesday, February 3rd. Today we\u0026rsquo;re covering the budget debate chaos, a press freedom controversy, President Ali\u0026rsquo;s Belize trip, and a murder that has the entire Rupununi demanding justice. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\n[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET DEBATE — 0:20-1:30]\nBudget 2026 debates opened yesterday at the Arthur Chung Conference Centre, and let me tell you — it was something. Stabroek News reported \u0026ldquo;bizarre animal noises\u0026rdquo; from the parliamentary benches. Welcome to democracy.\nFor the first time in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history, a party that is neither PNC nor PPP opened the debate for the opposition. WIN MP Dr. André Lewis delivered his maiden speech, arguing that the $1.558 trillion budget measures success in barrels and billions but not in the quality of people\u0026rsquo;s lives.\nNow here\u0026rsquo;s the irony of the century. Lewis demanded more oversight and transparency in mining. Meanwhile, the LEADER of his party, Azruddin Mohamed, is currently fighting extradition to Florida on eleven counts — including gold smuggling, wire fraud, and money laundering worth an alleged fifty million US dollars. Plus a Lamborghini. You truly cannot script this.\nOn the government side, Public Works Minister Juan Edghill called the budget a social contract of inclusion and rattled off the new bridge, new highways, and new airstrips. Education Minister Parag called the opposition\u0026rsquo;s tenure \u0026ldquo;lost years\u0026rdquo; and pointed to 6,000 GOAL graduates.\nAPNU\u0026rsquo;s Vinceroy Jordan went after agriculture spending, saying 85% of the agriculture budget goes to just two entities — Drainage and Irrigation and GuySuCo — leaving almost nothing for livestock and food production.\nThe most heated moment came when WIN\u0026rsquo;s Natasha Singh-Lewis called the budget \u0026ldquo;a farce,\u0026rdquo; citing women sleeping on road corners and children sleeping at Kumaka Landing. Minister Persaud fired back with Guyana\u0026rsquo;s Gender Gap ranking, the WIIN programme training 21,000 women, and $70 billion going directly to beneficiaries.\nBoth sides had points. Neither side was listening.\n[SEGMENT 2: MEDIA LOCKOUT — 1:30-2:15]\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a story that should concern every Guyanese regardless of party. Speaker Manzoor Nadir revived pandemic-era restrictions and limited press access to FIVE journalists at a time during budget debates. Five. In a building that cost billions and can seat hundreds.\nThe old Parliament Building on Brickdam — a tiny colonial-era space — allowed more journalists than that. Reporters now have to surrender their ID cards to receive a media pass. Kaieteur News is calling it a war on the press. Veteran reporters say they\u0026rsquo;ve never seen this level of contempt for media access.\nThe Speaker\u0026rsquo;s defense? He called it a continuation of COVID-era rules. The pandemic ended years ago. The budget is being livestreamed, yes — but camera coverage is not the same as journalists asking questions, observing body language, and holding power accountable in real time.\n[SEGMENT 3: ALI IN BELIZE — 2:15-2:50]\nWhile Parliament was erupting, President Ali was in Belize, addressing their National Assembly. He called on Guyana and Belize to lead Caribbean food security, demanded an end to trade barriers hurting regional farmers, and signed a sugar cooperation agreement.\nHe also cited unemployment data showing a drop from 12.8% in 2020 to 6.8% in late 2024, with female unemployment falling from 14.4% to under 9%.\nThe numbers sound good on paper. The opposition says they don\u0026rsquo;t match what people experience in their daily lives. The cost of living remains high, the Guyana dollar sits at 210 to the US dollar, and Kaieteur\u0026rsquo;s editorial asked the sharpest question of the day: \u0026ldquo;What is your bottom line?\u0026rdquo; Not the country\u0026rsquo;s. Yours.\n[SEGMENT 4: JUSTICE FOR RASTA — 2:50-3:30]\nThis is the story that deserves more attention than it\u0026rsquo;s getting. Leon \u0026ldquo;Rasta\u0026rdquo; Baird, a 38-year-old tour guide at Wichabai Ranch in the South Rupununi, was murdered on January 23rd after he stumbled upon cattle rustlers butchering stolen animals. His partially burnt body was found two days later.\nBaird wasn\u0026rsquo;t just anyone. He was a celebrated guide, an experienced vaquero, a senior ranger with the South Rupununi Conservation Society, and a co-author of published biodiversity research. He taught children to ride horses, harvest açaí berries, and respect the land. The ranch said simply: \u0026ldquo;Rasta died because he came across a crime being committed.\u0026rdquo;\nHis brother is demanding arrests. Visit Rupununi and the Rupununi Livestock Producers Association are calling for zero tolerance on cattle rustling. No one has been charged. The Guyana Police Force says the investigation is ongoing.\n[SEGMENT 5: QUICK HITS — 3:30-3:50]\nQuick hits: A Guyanese-American biotech innovator won the 2026 Sabga Award for Caribbean Excellence. Public Works rolled out a $4.3 billion sea defence plan with 21 projects. GOAL\u0026rsquo;s first PhD cohort graduated — 32 scholars, free of charge. And the Golden Jags Under-17 boys start CONCACAF qualifiers today in Honduras. A historic World Cup qualification is on the line. Good luck, boys.\n[OUTRO — 3:50-4:00]\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Tuesday Daily Brief, Guyana. Budget debates continue today. The question isn\u0026rsquo;t who wins the debate — it\u0026rsquo;s whether any of this changes your bottom line. I\u0026rsquo;m the Daily Brief.

We read the Chronicle, Stabroek, Kaieteur, and Times so you can start your Monday with laughs instead of headaches.\n🏛️ BUDGET 2026 DEBATE: GRAB YOUR POPCORN The National Assembly opens debate on the $1.558 TRILLION Budget 2026 today, and if you thought the presentation was dramatic, wait until the opposition gets the microphone.\nQuick refresher on what\u0026rsquo;s in this monster budget:\nBudget Item Amount Translation Education $183.6 billion More schools than students at this rate Healthcare $161.1 billion Six new hospitals commissioned last year alone Housing $159.1 billion 40,000 new homes promised — where, exactly? Agriculture $113.2 billion Because somebody has to grow the rice Security $100.3 billion Cameras. Cameras everywhere. Water $21.6 billion Clean water — revolutionary concept Finance Minister Ashni Singh says this budget represents a 307% increase over the $383 billion budget in 2021. Meanwhile, PM Phillips calls it an \u0026ldquo;irreversible shift\u0026rdquo; for Guyana.\nMcCoy is already warning about an opposition \u0026ldquo;misinformation machinery\u0026rdquo; ahead of debate. Translation: \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re going to say things we don\u0026rsquo;t like, and we\u0026rsquo;d like you to ignore them in advance.\u0026rdquo;\nThe opposition, meanwhile, is sharpening their pencils. Expect words like \u0026ldquo;reckless,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;unsustainable,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;where\u0026rsquo;s the money going?\u0026rdquo; to feature prominently.\n⚖️ MOHAMEDS EXTRADITION: THE RULING WE\u0026rsquo;VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR Today is the day. Acting Chief Justice Navindra Singh is expected to deliver his ruling on the constitutional challenge and judicial review filed by gold traders Azruddin Mohamed and his father Nazar Mohamed.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the situation in a nutshell:\nThe Mohameds say: The extradition process was tainted by bias. The Home Affairs Minister\u0026rsquo;s decision to issue the authority to proceed was unlawful. Also, sections of the Fugitive Offenders Act are unconstitutional.\nThe Attorney General says: Everything was done by the book. No procedural violation. No unlawful conduct. Next question.\nRemember, Azruddin Mohamed is also the duly elected Leader of the Opposition — a fact the Chronicle keeps putting in scare quotes and Stabroek keeps mentioning alongside his US indictment. The government has been accused of delaying National Assembly sittings hoping an extradition order gets issued first.\nThe prosecution even tried to move the extradition hearing to an EARLIER date after initially agreeing to February 5-6, which the defence said was impossible. Make of that what you will.\n🏨 PLAZA COURT HOTEL: GEORGETOWN GOES UPSCALE The Plaza Court Hotel opened on Main Street, Georgetown, over the weekend — a sleek 60-room facility built by Dharwan Construction Group. President Ali himself showed up for the opening.\nThis is part of Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s slow but steady transformation from \u0026ldquo;city with potholes that have their own postal codes\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;actual tourism destination.\u0026rdquo; The government has earmarked $2.2 billion to complete the Hospitality and Tourism Institute, which will train over 700 people for the expanding tourism sector.\nFun fact: Guyana recorded a record 453,489 visitors in 2025. At this rate, we\u0026rsquo;ll need hotels faster than we can build them.\n🎭 MASHRAMANI 2026: $120 MILLION AND COUNTING The government is investing over $120 million in Mashramani 2026 — the largest investment ever in the annual Republic Day celebration. The theme? \u0026ldquo;Expressing our culture through innovation and creativity.\u0026rdquo;\nMinister Ramson launched the festivities at the Railway Courtyard on Friday, and the Ministry of Education already unveiled its Mash band.\nThis year marks Guyana\u0026rsquo;s 60th Independence anniversary, so expect the celebration to be bigger, louder, and more colourful than usual. Whether the costumes will be more creative than last year\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;we ran out of fabric at the last minute\u0026rdquo; aesthetic remains to be seen.\n🏡 HYDE PARK HOMESTEAD: WOMEN APPLAUD NEW HOUSING Women and single mothers are praising the Hyde Park Homestead Project, with beneficiaries highlighting the accessible process, affordable homes, and family-friendly designs.\nMeanwhile, the government is also building new truck parks to ease congestion and improve communities. Because nothing says \u0026ldquo;community improvement\u0026rdquo; like giving the big rigs their own parking lot instead of blocking your street.\n🐄 CATTLE RUSTLERS BLAMED FOR CONSERVATIONIST\u0026rsquo;S DEATH In deeply sad news, Leon Baird, a well-known Rupununi conservationist, was killed — and cattle rustlers are being blamed. This story highlights the ongoing challenges in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s hinterland, where wildlife conservation and cattle ranching often collide in tragic ways.\n🇬🇧 UK-GUYANA: CLIMATE BUDDIES FOREVER Guyana and the UK have strengthened their climate and biodiversity partnership, with UK Deputy PM David Lammy calling the UK \u0026ldquo;proud\u0026rdquo; to be a new signatory to the Global Biodiversity Alliance.\nPresident Ali\u0026rsquo;s recent UK visit positioned Guyana as more than just an \u0026ldquo;environmental bystander.\u0026rdquo; The Chronicle ran this with approximately seventeen photographs of the handshake.\n📊 MONDAY SCORECARD Category Status Mood Budget Debate Opens today 🍿 Mohameds Ruling Expected today ⚖️ New Hotel Open for business 🏨 Mashramani $120M invested 🎭 Housing Women applauding 🏡 Conservationist Killed by rustlers 😢 UK Partnership Handshakes for days 🤝 📰 QUICK HITS FROM THE PAPERS Chronicle: President Ali urges diaspora to return home, saying \u0026ldquo;the government will co-invest with you.\u0026rdquo; Also running letters praising Budget 2026 as \u0026ldquo;exceptional.\u0026rdquo;\nStabroek: Opposition parties APNU and WIN express concern over the state of Tabatinga Secondary School construction — MP Sherod Duncan says it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;far from operational readiness.\u0026rdquo; Also, Guyana Bar Association President warns that weak disciplinary enforcement undermines justice delivery.\nKaieteur: Still hammering on the Stabroek Block ring-fencing issue and pointing out the government \u0026ldquo;settled for a small bone.\u0026rdquo; Also covering the Canadian High Commissioner\u0026rsquo;s reminder that \u0026ldquo;Parliament is the cornerstone of democracy.\u0026rdquo; Shots fired. Diplomatically.\nGuyana Times: Running education content about children with disabilities getting new facilities and the launch of an anti-bullying app by the Ministry of Education.\n💭 THOUGHT OF THE DAY Budget debate opening on the same day as the Mohameds ruling is either coincidence or the most perfectly Guyanese scheduling in history.

The opposition Democratic Labour Party (DLP), now led by Ralph Thorne — a former BLP member who defected in 2024 — is trying to break the streak.\nFive parties have filed candidates: BLP, DLP, Reform Barbados, Friends of Democracy, and the People\u0026rsquo;s Coalition for Progress (an alliance of three smaller parties). The PCP is running 15 candidates and wants to reduce the number of constituencies from 30.\nPolitical analyst Peter Wickham summed up the race this way: the question isn\u0026rsquo;t whether Mottley wins, it\u0026rsquo;s whether the DLP can win even ONE seat. That\u0026rsquo;s the level of dominance we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nMottley is running on 17 consecutive quarters of economic growth and record foreign reserves. Her message to supporters: \u0026ldquo;We are red and ready.\u0026rdquo;\nThe DLP\u0026rsquo;s message: \u0026ldquo;Please just give us a chance this time.\u0026rdquo;\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: POLICE SHOOTING SPARKS NATIONAL OUTRAGE Trinidad and Tobago is in uproar after CCTV footage showed police officers shooting 31-year-old Joshua Samaroo as he appeared to be surrendering with his hands in the air after a car chase. His common-law wife, Kaia Sealy, was also shot and is now paralysed.\nThe footage showed at least 17 shots fired at the vehicle after it crashed. The Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago (LATT) has questioned Commissioner of Police Allister Guevarro\u0026rsquo;s decision not to suspend the officers, noting the footage showed neither occupant engaging in gunfire.\nThis is the fourth police killing in Trinidad for 2026 — following a trend where fatal police shootings went from 45 in 2023 to 54 in 2024 to 68 in 2025. The officers have since been moved off field duty.\nThe family is calling for an independent investigation, and the country is asking hard questions about the use of deadly force during what was nine months of states of emergency in 2025.\nMeanwhile, the government is pushing to replace the expired state of emergency with \u0026ldquo;zones of special operations\u0026rdquo; — essentially the same powers with a different name.\n🎭 CARNIVAL SEASON: THE ISLANDS ARE VIBRATING It\u0026rsquo;s that time of year. Trinidad Carnival is approaching fast, and the soca, chutney, and steelpan are in full rotation.\nHighlights from the carnival buildup include the Passage to Asia fete, the WND Park Race cycling season opener, and pan prelims across the country. Chutney soca singer Wackerman has a new socially conscious entry for 2026.\nFor those planning to head down: accommodation is filling up FAST. The ferry service between Trinidad and Tobago has been dealing with vessel issues — the recently leased Blue Wave Harmony was reportedly damaged — but the government says operations haven\u0026rsquo;t been disrupted.\nMinister of Culture Michelle Benjamin says she\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;determined to evolve and enhance the cultural sector.\u0026rdquo; Translation: bigger fetes, more funding, and probably a new Ministry selfie at every event.\n🏏 CRICKET: WEST INDIES PREP FOR T20 WORLD CUP Afghanistan and West Indies are set to tune up for the T20 World Cup (starting February 7 in India and Sri Lanka) with a three-match T20I series in Dubai.\nThe conditions in Dubai should be \u0026ldquo;fairly comparable\u0026rdquo; to the subcontinent — which is cricket-speak for \u0026ldquo;at least it\u0026rsquo;s not England.\u0026rdquo;\nBack in Guyana, women\u0026rsquo;s cricket is thriving — Guyana defeated Jamaica in the CWI Women\u0026rsquo;s Blaze T20 Championships, though they suffered a heartbreaking 7-run loss to the Leeward Islands.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: DISABILITIES ACT TAKES EFFECT Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s Disabilities Act comes into effect today, marking a major step forward for the rights of persons with disabilities on the island. The government celebrated with events across Kingston.\nIn other Jamaica news, PM Andrew Holness has been urging Jamaicans to \u0026ldquo;focus on building a future at home\u0026rdquo; after the US paused immigrant visas for 75 countries, including Jamaica. The economy grew 5.1% in the July-September 2025 quarter, and the US recently lowered its travel advisory for Jamaica to Level 2.\n🌊 REGIONAL ROUNDUP Antigua \u0026amp; Barbuda: Contracting over 100 nurses from Ghana while insisting they haven\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;ended\u0026rdquo; their existing nursing arrangements. Cabinet also confirmed there\u0026rsquo;s no dengue outbreak despite rumours.\nHaiti: Bishop Pierre-André Dumas withdrew from a proposed national mediation process aimed at preventing instability ahead of the transitional government\u0026rsquo;s deadline. As one Haitian comedian put it: \u0026ldquo;Even the Church gave up on us.\u0026rdquo;\nSt. Vincent: Strengthening surveillance of La Soufrière volcano. When your biggest worry is literally the ground exploding, everything else seems manageable.\nDominica: Launched \u0026ldquo;Glory in Paradise,\u0026rdquo; a new national gospel festival. Proof that faith and tourism can coexist — usually on the same dance floor.\n📊 CARIBBEAN WATCH Country Big Story Countdown Barbados General Election 9 days (Feb 11) Trinidad Police shooting scandal Ongoing investigation Jamaica Disabilities Act Effective today Guyana Budget 2026 debate Opens today Caribbean T20 World Cup 5 days (Feb 7) 💭 REGIONAL THOUGHT Nine days until Barbados votes.

Monday morning and me reading the Chronicle with me coffee, and boy oh boy, THIS is the Guyana I been telling all you doubters about.\nBUDGET 2026: A MASTERCLASS IN NATION-BUILDING You see this budget? $1.558 TRILLION. That is a 307% increase from 2021! When the PNC was running things, the budget was pocket change. Now look at we.\nLet me break it down for the skeptics in the back:\n$183.6 billion for education — Guyana Digital School already has 22,000 students registered, and by March every secondary grade will have access. Back in my day, we had one textbook shared between three classes!\n$161.1 billion for healthcare — Training 162 new specialist doctors in neurosurgery, urology, and anaesthesiology. PLUS 5,440 nurses. The government commissioning SIX new hospitals last year and adding 74 maternal beds? That is what caring about people looks like.\n$159.1 billion for housing — 40,000 new homes coming. Hyde Park Homestead already making women and single mothers happy. This government building homes, not making excuses.\n$100.3 billion for security — Record investment. Crime at historically low levels. Cameras on the road saving lives. But the opposition will still complain because complaining is the only job they qualify for.\nAnd the Because We Care grant going up to $60,000! The old age pension increasing to $46,000 per month PLUS a $20,000 transportation grant for pensioners? ME AUNTY IN BERBICE CRYING HAPPY TEARS RIGHT NOW.\nPLAZA COURT HOTEL — GEORGETOWN LOOKING LIKE A REAL CAPITAL NOW Sixty rooms! International standard! Dharwan Construction build it nice-nice. President Ali was there for the opening and rightly so — this is what happens when you create an investment-friendly environment.\nAnd 453,489 visitors in 2025? RECORD NUMBERS. Tourism sector growing, hotels popping up, and the Hospitality Institute will train 700 more workers. This is an economy FIRING on all cylinders.\nUK PARTNERSHIP — THE WORLD RESPECTS US NOW UK Deputy PM David Lammy came and signed onto the Global Biodiversity Alliance. The UK calling itself \u0026ldquo;proud\u0026rdquo; to partner with little Guyana. You know how big that is? When I left Berbice, nobody knew where Guyana was. Now the British Deputy Prime Minister flying in for meetings.\nPresident Ali positioned Guyana as a LEADER in climate action, not just a participant. That is statesmanship.\nMASHRAMANI — $120 MILLION BECAUSE WE DESERVE IT Biggest investment EVER in Mashramani. 60th Independence anniversary. Theme about culture and innovation. Minister Ramson and Minister Jacobs got this under control.\nFor all the people abroad who miss home — book your tickets. Mash 2026 going to be SPECIAL.\nDIASPORA — COME HOME AND INVEST President Ali said it clear: \u0026ldquo;The government will co-invest with you.\u0026rdquo; No corporate tax for elderly care, children\u0026rsquo;s care, hospitals. Tax-free earnings if you build these facilities.\nI telling all my friends in Richmond Hill and Queens — the opportunity is NOW. This is not the Guyana you left. This is a Guyana that is building for the future, and they want YOU to be part of it.\nAS FOR THE OPPOSITION\u0026hellip; They worried about Tabatinga School not being ready? The government building more schools than the opposition ever dreamed of. One school under construction and they running to the media like the sky falling.\nThe Mohameds ruling coming today too. Whatever happens, remember — the Opposition Leader situation was created by the opposition themselves. You choose a man with US extradition proceedings as your leader, you get drama. Simple.\nBudget debate opening today and I already know what the opposition going to say: \u0026ldquo;Too much spending! Where the money going?\u0026rdquo; Same people who left the economy in shambles want to lecture about fiscal responsibility. Please.\nBottom line: Guyana is being transformed before our eyes. The numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie, the hotels don\u0026rsquo;t lie, the schools don\u0026rsquo;t lie, and the UK Deputy PM didn\u0026rsquo;t fly to Georgetown for fun.

Welcome to The Guyana Brief for Monday, February 2nd, 2026. Big, big day for Guyana. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it.\n[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET DEBATE]\nFirst up — Budget 2026 debate officially opens today in the National Assembly. This is a one point five five eight TRILLION dollar budget — a 307% increase from 2021. Finance Minister Ashni Singh says it\u0026rsquo;s all about putting people first.\nThe highlights? 183 billion for education, including the Guyana Digital School with 22,000 students already signed up. 161 billion for healthcare — we\u0026rsquo;re training 162 specialist doctors and over 5,000 nurses. 159 billion for housing, with 40,000 new homes promised. And every adult 18 and over getting that $100,000 cash grant.\nNow, the opposition is calling this reckless spending. The government says it\u0026rsquo;s nation-building. Expect fireworks in the Assembly today — both sides have a LOT to say.\n[SEGMENT 2: MOHAMEDS RULING]\nAlso happening TODAY — the Acting Chief Justice is expected to rule on the Mohameds extradition case. Gold traders Azruddin and Nazar Mohamed are challenging the entire extradition process, saying the Home Affairs Minister\u0026rsquo;s decision was unlawful and biased.\nRemember, Azruddin Mohamed is the elected Leader of the Opposition. The government has been accused of delaying Parliament sittings hoping an extradition order comes through first. The prosecution even tried to rush the hearing to an earlier date. Whatever the ruling is today, it\u0026rsquo;s going to have massive political implications.\n[SEGMENT 3: DEVELOPMENT NEWS]\nOn the development front — the Plaza Court Hotel opened on Main Street Georgetown this weekend. Sixty rooms, modern design, international standards. President Ali was at the ribbon cutting. Guyana hit 453,000 visitors last year, so we need every hotel room we can get.\nPlus, the government is investing over 120 million dollars in Mashramani 2026 — the biggest Mash investment ever. It\u0026rsquo;s Guyana\u0026rsquo;s 60th Independence anniversary, so expect costumes, music, and celebrations like never before.\nThe UK partnership also got stronger — Deputy PM David Lammy came to Georgetown and signed onto the Global Biodiversity Alliance. The world is watching Guyana, and they\u0026rsquo;re impressed.\n[SEGMENT 4: CARIBBEAN ROUNDUP]\nQuick Caribbean roundup! Barbados goes to the polls on February 11 — that\u0026rsquo;s nine days away. PM Mia Mottley is going for a THIRD consecutive term. The DLP hasn\u0026rsquo;t won a single seat in two elections. Can they break the streak? Most analysts say no.\nIn Trinidad, there\u0026rsquo;s massive outrage after CCTV footage showed police shooting a man who appeared to have his hands in the air. The Law Association is questioning the police commissioner\u0026rsquo;s decision not to suspend the officers. This is the fourth police killing in Trinidad for 2026.\nAnd cricket fans — West Indies vs Afghanistan T20 series starts in Dubai as warmup for the T20 World Cup on February 7th!\n[CLOSING]\nThat\u0026rsquo;s your Monday brief, Guyana!

Translation: \u0026ldquo;If you disagree with us, you\u0026rsquo;re spreading misinformation.\u0026rdquo;\nThe opposition hasn\u0026rsquo;t even started talking yet and the government is already building the defence wall. Monday should be entertaining.\n💰 Finance Minister Discovers \u0026ldquo;Late Movers\u0026rsquo; Advantage\u0026rdquo; Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh went on Hits and Jams 94.1 — because that\u0026rsquo;s where you discuss trillion-dollar budgets — and explained that Guyana has a \u0026ldquo;late movers\u0026rsquo; advantage\u0026rdquo; in oil and gas.\n\u0026ldquo;We are able to look around at the collective experience, what other countries did, what they did that worked,\u0026rdquo; he said, before adding that Guyana won\u0026rsquo;t repeat other countries\u0026rsquo; mistakes.\nWhich is fascinating, because critics have been saying for years that the 2016 Exxon contract IS the mistake other countries will study to avoid. Ten times more oil blocks given away than industry standard? No ring-fencing? Paying the company\u0026rsquo;s taxes from our own share? That\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;late movers\u0026rsquo; advantage\u0026rdquo; — that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;late to realising we got played.\u0026rdquo;\nBut sure. Late movers\u0026rsquo; advantage. Sounds very academic.\n🌉 Unlicensed Driver Kills on Demerara River Bridge A cement truck rolled backward down the Bharrat Jagdeo Demerara River Bridge on Thursday, causing a multi-vehicle collision that killed one person and seriously injured another.\nThe driver? Twenty-three years old. From Anna Catherina. And — wait for it — not licensed to drive that type of vehicle.\nLet that marinate. An unlicensed driver was behind the wheel of a heavy cement truck on the country\u0026rsquo;s most important bridge. The driver has been remanded; the truck owner granted bail.\nMinister Edghill thanked first responders and engineers cleared debris from the bridge. All very professional after the fact. Nobody is asking who let this man on the bridge in the first place with no papers.\n🏫 Opposition Says Tabatinga School Far From Ready APNU and WIN visited the Tabatinga Secondary School construction site and came back with bad news: the school is \u0026ldquo;far from operational readiness.\u0026rdquo;\nAPNU MP Sherod Duncan led the site visit and said the state of construction suggests this school is nowhere near serving students anytime soon. This follows a pattern of infrastructure projects where timelines and reality exist in parallel universes.\nThe government has yet to respond, which usually means either \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll get to it\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the opposition is lying.\u0026rdquo; Place your bets.\n🏦 Guyana Development Bank: US$100M, No Collateral, No Interest The government announced the Guyana Development Bank, backed by US$100 million, offering interest-free loans with no collateral for youth, women, and persons with disabilities.\nLabour Minister Keoma Griffith called it a \u0026ldquo;game changer,\u0026rdquo; saying: \u0026ldquo;We have removed many of the barriers to persons who are seeking to access capital.\u0026rdquo;\nSounds wonderful on paper. But the details? \u0026ldquo;Systems are actively being built.\u0026rdquo; Translation: the announcement came before the infrastructure. Classic Guyana governance — announce the headline, build the thing later. Or maybe this is part of that \u0026ldquo;late movers\u0026rsquo; advantage\u0026rdquo; Dr. Singh was talking about.\n🇬🇧 Guyana and UK Strengthen Climate Partnership President Ali visited the UK, and the two countries strengthened their climate and biodiversity partnership. The UK Deputy PM said Britain is \u0026ldquo;proud\u0026rdquo; to be a new signatory to the Global Biodiversity Alliance.\nThe Chronicle covered this like the Second Coming. Four paragraphs on how Guyana is not just an \u0026ldquo;environmental bystander\u0026rdquo; but a leader. Meanwhile, West Watooka is flooding and the government just installed a mobile pump.\nLeadership indeed.\n🌊 West Watooka Flooding — Mobile Pump Deployed Region Ten residents dealing with flooding in West Watooka got some relief when the government installed a mobile pump on Thursday.\nA mobile pump. For a problem that happens every single rainy season. You\u0026rsquo;d think after the third or fourth flood, someone would build a permanent drainage solution. But no. Mobile pump. Because nothing says \u0026ldquo;long-term planning\u0026rdquo; like a piece of equipment you have to truck in every year.\n🔫 Man Shot Dead in Albouystown Kevon \u0026ldquo;Author\u0026rdquo; Ridley, 28, a labourer from James Street, Albouystown, was shot dead Thursday evening when an unidentified man opened fire. Two others were injured. No arrests have been made.\nAnother day, another shooting, another investigation \u0026ldquo;continuing.\u0026rdquo; The streets don\u0026rsquo;t wait for budget debates.\n🏇 Banks Classic Kicks Off Guyana Cup Season Today On a lighter note, the Banks Classic horse racing kicks off today at Port Mourant Turf Club — the first event of the Guyana Cup Nomination Series. Ten races, $12.75 million in total prize money, sponsored by Banks DIH.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to Port Mourant, just bet on whichever horse has the best name. That strategy works as well as any other.\n🎭 Mashramani 2026 Launch — But Where\u0026rsquo;s the 400th Anniversary? The Ministry of Education launched its Mashramani band Friday night as part of the Mash 2026 celebrations. Twenty scheduled activities are planned.\nBut a letter in Stabroek News raised an uncomfortable question: 2026 is the 400th anniversary of Africans in Guyana. Where are the commemorations? The writer noted that Indian Arrival Day got a 40-page Chronicle insert last year. Emancipation Day got nothing comparable. The Guyana Reparations Committee applied for Castellani House for a February exhibition to mark the occasion.\nSilence from the government. Mash is scheduled. The 400th anniversary? Not so much.\n🇻🇪 Venezuela Update: Maduro Captured, Guyana Still Watching For those keeping track: it\u0026rsquo;s been almost a month since the US captured Maduro on January 3. Venezuelan VP Delcy Rodriguez is reportedly running things. Guyana\u0026rsquo;s border remains on heightened alert. President Ali says the security architecture is \u0026ldquo;fully active.\u0026rdquo;\nWIN\u0026rsquo;s GECOM fight continues in the background — Azruddin Mohamed wants opposition-nominated commissioners replaced, GECOM Chair says she has \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; authority to make them resign. That saga will outlast all of us.\n📊 Sunday Scorecard Story Government Spin Reality Check Development Bank \u0026ldquo;Game changer! No collateral!\u0026rdquo; Systems still being built Budget 2026 \u0026ldquo;Ambitious, bold!\u0026rdquo; Debate hasn\u0026rsquo;t started yet Oil management \u0026ldquo;Late movers\u0026rsquo; advantage\u0026rdquo; 2016 contract says otherwise Demerara Bridge crash \u0026ldquo;First responders were great\u0026rdquo; Unlicensed driver on the bridge West Watooka flooding \u0026ldquo;Mobile pump installed\u0026rdquo; Same problem every year 400th anniversary Silence Mash gets 20 events instead That\u0026rsquo;s your Sunday Brief.

Your 5-minute Sunday news circus.","title":"☕ Sunday Brief: Budget Debate Opens Monday, Cement Truck Kills on Demerara Bridge, and the Government Discovers 'Late Movers' Advantage'"},{"content":"Uncle Ramesh is a retired accountant from Berbice, now living in Queens, NY. He reads the papers himself — especially the Chronicle — and gives his independent pro-government perspective. He does NOT simply respond to the Daily Brief.\n☕ Good Morning from Queens Nephew, I wake up this Sunday morning, make my tea, open the Chronicle, and I see PROGRESS everywhere. Budget debate starting Monday. Development Bank announced. UK partnership strengthened. $1 billion invested in Mahdia roads. Tourism sector getting new support.\nAnd then I open de Brief and is like dem reading a different country papers.\n💰 Budget 2026: $1.558 TRILLION of Vision Listen, when this government present a $1.558 trillion budget, that is not just numbers. That is VISION. Minister Rodrigues correct — this budget is ambitious and bold. And it SHOULD be ambitious and bold because we have the resources now to match the ambition.\nThe Chronicle report that this is the first instalment in delivering the 2026-2030 manifesto vision. Every single allocation — from housing to health to education to infrastructure — is backed by revenue. This is not fantasy budgeting. This is a government that won an election and is delivering on promises.\nThe opposition going to get up Monday and complain. That is their job. But the PEOPLE know what this budget means for their lives.\n🏦 The Development Bank Is a Game Changer — Full Stop The Brief make joke about the Development Bank announcement. But let me tell you something as a retired accountant: US$100 million in interest-free loans, no collateral required, targeting youth, women, and persons with disabilities — that is REVOLUTIONARY for Guyana.\nDo you know how many brilliant young Guyanese can\u0026rsquo;t start a business because the commercial banks want collateral they don\u0026rsquo;t have? Do you know how many women with good ideas get turned away? Minister Griffith is right — this removes barriers that existed for DECADES under every previous government.\nThe Brief say \u0026ldquo;announcement came before infrastructure.\u0026rdquo; That is how government works! You announce the policy, you build the system, you deliver. What — they want the government to build everything in secret and then surprise people? This is transparency. This is accountability.\n🇬🇧 UK Partnership Shows Guyana\u0026rsquo;s Global Standing President Ali visit to the UK — and the UK Deputy PM saying they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;proud\u0026rdquo; to partner with Guyana on climate and biodiversity — that is international recognition of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s leadership.\nThe Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t even give this proper coverage. Five years ago, nobody in London was talking about Guyana. Now the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is signing agreements with us. That is what happens when you have a President who can walk into ANY room in the world and command respect.\n🛤️ $1 Billion in Mahdia Roads — Local Contractors Benefiting The Chronicle report that over $1.066 billion was invested in completed road rehabilitation in Mahdia, Region Eight. And ALL the work was done by LOCAL contractors.\nThat is money going directly into hinterland communities. That is jobs for Guyanese people. Minister Ramraj personally inspected the work and held contractors accountable for quality. That is governance.\nThe Brief didn\u0026rsquo;t mention this at all. Too busy making jokes about mobile pumps.\n🌉 On the Demerara Bridge Incident Yes, the bridge accident was tragic and the unlicensed driver is a serious issue. But Minister Edghill responded immediately. First responders were on scene. The driver was arrested. The truck owner was charged.\nThat is the system working. The Brief want to blame the government for every individual who breaks the law. Should the government personally check every driver\u0026rsquo;s licence before they cross the bridge? The person committed a crime and is being prosecuted. What more do you want?\n📺 What the Brief MISSED As usual, the Brief skipped stories that show progress:\nTourism getting major Budget 2026 support — tourism providers praised the new measures. This sector is going to EXPLODE in the next five years.\nMinister Rodrigues emphasized that Budget 2026 puts \u0026ldquo;Guyanese at the centre of prosperity.\u0026rdquo; Not foreign companies. Not consultants. GUYANESE.\n$50 billion for Region Three farm-to-market roads — the government mapping out strategic food production plans. This is food security. This is agriculture development. This is REAL work.\nBut the Brief too busy with scorecard jokes to cover substance.\n🇻🇪 On Venezuela Maduro captured. Guyana\u0026rsquo;s borders secure. Security forces fully mobilised. President Ali handled this crisis with calm, decisive leadership from day one.\nThe opposition? Busy fighting over GECOM seats while the country faces real security challenges. Priorities.\n📋 Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Sunday Summary What Happened What It Means Budget 2026 debate Monday Government delivering on promises Development Bank announced Revolutionary access to capital UK climate partnership Global recognition of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s leadership $1B in Mahdia roads Hinterland development with local contractors Tourism support in budget Sector ready to boom Borders secure President Ali leading from the front This is what progress looks like, nephew.

Because Guyana isn\u0026rsquo;t the only place where the news is stranger than fiction. 🌴\n🇯🇲 Jamaica: IMF Approves US$415M Emergency Assistance The IMF Executive Board approved approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance for Jamaica to help meet urgent balance-of-payments needs stemming from Hurricane Melissa\u0026rsquo;s devastating impact.\nJamaica\u0026rsquo;s international reserves remain \u0026ldquo;historically strong\u0026rdquo; but the external position weakened significantly after the hurricane. Meanwhile, PM Holness is riding high as the first JLP leader to win three consecutive terms. Winning elections AND getting IMF money? That\u0026rsquo;s a Jamaican double.\nIn other Jamaica news, West Indies Petroleum Terminal Limited successfully listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange. Jamaica collecting revenue streams like Pokémon cards.\n🇺🇸 US Tightens Visa Screws on Caribbean Nationals If you thought getting a US visa was already painful, 2026 just made it worse. The Trump administration is cracking down on \u0026ldquo;birth tourism,\u0026rdquo; and Caribbean nations including Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua, Dominica, and Grenada are all facing stricter scrutiny.\nConsular officers now probe travel purpose, maternity plans, accommodation details, and medical insurance coverage. They\u0026rsquo;re even checking your SOCIAL MEDIA for mentions of US hospitals or maternity plans.\nSo if you posted a baby shower photo with a caption about \u0026ldquo;Miami delivery\u0026rdquo; — that visa interview just got a lot more interesting. Caribbean nationals planning legitimate travel are caught in the crossfire. More documentation required, longer processing times, and higher denial rates expected across the board.\n🇹🇹 Trinidad: \u0026ldquo;We Didn\u0026rsquo;t Do It\u0026rdquo; — Part 47 A full month after the US captured Maduro on January 3, Trinidad and Tobago is STILL reminding everyone that they had nothing to do with the Venezuela operation. PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar\u0026rsquo;s statement from that morning — \u0026ldquo;Trinidad and Tobago is NOT a participant in any of these ongoing military operations\u0026rdquo; — has become practically a national motto.\nNever mind that Trinidad previously allowed US military radar and exercises in Tobago. Never mind the US military buildup in the Caribbean Sea. Trinidad just wants everyone to know: they were sleeping when it happened.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration reaffirmed its \u0026ldquo;strong partnership\u0026rdquo; with Trinidad. Which is exactly what you tell someone after using their backyard to stage an operation they claim to know nothing about.\n🇧🇧 Barbados Questions US Drug Vessel Strikes Barbados\u0026rsquo; Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds raised concerns about US military strikes on vessels suspected of drug trafficking in the Caribbean, saying the actions \u0026ldquo;may have bypassed due process\u0026rdquo; and risk setting a \u0026ldquo;dangerous precedent.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen Barbados — a country of 280,000 people — is lecturing the United States on due process, you know the regional temperature is rising. Amnesty International also warned that any airstrikes authorized by Congress could violate international human rights law.\nThe US response? More ships in the Caribbean Sea. Diplomacy at its finest.\n🏏 West Indies Cricket: T20 World Cup Prep Afghanistan and West Indies are tuning up for the T20 World Cup (kicking off February 7 in India and Sri Lanka) with a three-match T20I series in Dubai. The Windies need all the practice they can get — but at least the conditions in Dubai are \u0026ldquo;fairly comparable.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, back home, the WND Park Series cycling season opened at the National Park despite heavy winds and rain. Briton John dominated for We Stand United. Caribbean sport doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop for weather.\n🌊 Regional Roundup Dominica launched \u0026ldquo;Glory in Paradise,\u0026rdquo; a new national gospel festival. Because if you can\u0026rsquo;t fix the economy, at least you can praise the Lord about it.\nGrenada\u0026rsquo;s special 50-dollar banknote (issued for their 50th independence anniversary) can now be used across the entire Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

I\u0026rsquo;m your host and we got a LOT to cover today because January is wrapping up with a BANG. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it!\n[BEAT — TRANSITION]\nFirst up — BUDGET 2026. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard the number by now, here it is one more time: one-point-five-five-eight TRILLION dollars. That\u0026rsquo;s the biggest national budget in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s entire history. Finance Minister Ashni Singh presented it on Monday and the country hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped talking since.\nThe highlights? A hundred-thousand-dollar cash grant for every Guyanese citizen eighteen and older. Three million dollars in zero-interest loans for small businesses. Mortgage relief on loans up to thirty million. All taxes eliminated on agriculture and agro-processing. And the government says it\u0026rsquo;s absorbing hundreds of billions in inflationary pressure to keep prices down.\nNow, the opposition? They\u0026rsquo;re saying this budget benefits the wealthy and leaves ordinary Guyanese behind. Commentators in Kaieteur News comparing it to a feast for the rich. The truth is probably somewhere in between, but one thing is certain — the NUMBERS are massive and Guyana is playing in a league nobody expected.\n[BEAT — TRANSITION]\nNext — international relations are POPPING. UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy visited Guyana this week and signed on to our Global Biodiversity Alliance. He literally said the UK is \u0026ldquo;proud\u0026rdquo; to be a signatory. Think about that — the former colonial power coming to Guyana and saying THEY are proud to join OUR initiative. Times have changed!\nAnd speaking of international moves — Bangladesh just announced they\u0026rsquo;re opening a diplomatic mission in Georgetown. They\u0026rsquo;re eyeing our economy — which grew nearly fifty percent last year — and want in. Three new EU business missions are also planned for 2026 as part of an agro-processing partnership with Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Europe wants our cacao, our avocado, our bananas. The breadbasket dream is getting real!\n[BEAT — TRANSITION]\nNow to oil. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods confirmed on an earnings call that the company is producing roughly eight-hundred-seventy-five-thousand barrels per day from Guyana. That\u0026rsquo;s a hundred thousand barrels ABOVE investment projections. Four FPSOs running and all performing above expectations.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the interesting part — Woods said the company is now considering exploration in parts of the Stabroek Block closer to the Venezuelan border. With the capture of Maduro and reduced naval patrols in the area, ExxonMobil sees an opportunity. The Stabroek Block exploration licence expires in late 2027, and the ICJ border ruling will be a critical milestone.\n[BEAT — TRANSITION]\nWe do have to cover some difficult news. On Thursday, a cement-laden motor lorry rolled backwards on the Bharrat Jagdeo Demerara River Bridge, causing a multi-vehicle collision. Twenty-four-year-old Scott Dorwart of Grove, East Bank Demerara, lost his life. Police revealed the driver — a twenty-three-year-old — didn\u0026rsquo;t have the proper licence category to operate a lorry. Both the driver and the truck owner face charges. Our hearts go out to the Dorwart family.\nSeparately, in Albouystown, twenty-eight-year-old Kevon Ridley was shot and killed Thursday evening. Two others were injured. No arrests have been made. Another young life lost to gun violence.\n[BEAT — TRANSITION]\nOn the positive side — GO-Invest facilitated a nearly one-billion-dollar investment in neurological healthcare through Neurospine Services. Guyanese who previously had to travel abroad for specialised spine and neurological care may soon have world-class options right here in Georgetown.\nThe Bayrock Track and Field Stadium opens TODAY in Linden! Banks Classic horse racing kicks off TOMORROW at Port Mourant with twelve-point-seven-five million in purse money!

We read the news so you can laugh at it! 🇬🇾\n🎯 THE BIG STORY: GRA Officers Fired Over Mohamed Vehicle Transfers Well, well, well. The Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) has terminated several employees and is preparing to charge them under the Anti-Money Laundering Act for allegedly helping sanctioned businessman Azruddin Mohamed transfer vehicles.\nYes, THAT Azruddin Mohamed. The newly minted Opposition Leader. The one the US Treasury says is involved in gold smuggling and money laundering. That one.\nThe Daily Brief\u0026rsquo;s translation: GRA officers saw a man wanted by the United States government and said \u0026ldquo;Sure, we\u0026rsquo;ll help you move your cars around. What could possibly go wrong?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat went wrong: Everything.\nNow they\u0026rsquo;re fired AND facing criminal charges. Perhaps they should have Googled \u0026ldquo;Azruddin Mohamed\u0026rdquo; before processing those transfers.\n🏭 RUSAL IS BACK: Russians Return to Bauxite Mining In news that sounds like a headline from 2019, RUSAL (Russian Aluminium) is returning to Guyana six years after they shut down operations during a labor dispute.\nFinance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh announced that the government reached an agreement \u0026ldquo;a few days ago\u0026rdquo; for RUSAL to resume bauxite mining in the upper Berbice area.\nThe Brief asks: What changed? Did they finally agree to pay workers a living wage, or did the government just really miss the Russians?\nFun fact: RUSAL left in 2019 after a bitter dispute with workers. Now they\u0026rsquo;re coming back. Either someone learned their lesson, or everyone conveniently forgot what the fight was about.\n💰 CHRISTOPHER RAM: Government Needs Fiscal Ozempic Chartered accountant Christopher Ram is warning the government about excessive spending, particularly with oil prices expected to drop to $50 per barrel.\nHis prescription? The government needs \u0026ldquo;the fiscal equivalent of Ozempic – a firm and sustained dose of appetite control to curb the compulsion to spend simply because there is no obvious restraint.\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: Stop eating the oil money like it\u0026rsquo;s an all-you-can-eat buffet.\nRam argues that \u0026ldquo;years of aggressive fiscal stimulation\u0026rdquo; have \u0026ldquo;dulled discipline and restraint.\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;s basically saying the government is on spending steroids and needs to detox.\nThe government\u0026rsquo;s likely response: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not addicted to spending. We can stop whenever we want. Right after this next mega-project.\u0026rdquo;\n🏠 HOUSING NUMBERS: 15,000 Lots, 8,000 Homes Planned The government has announced plans for 15,000 new house lots and 8,000 homes in 2026 as part of its continuing housing program.\nFinance Minister Singh told the National Assembly that investments in housing are \u0026ldquo;not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Brief observes: That\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful sentiment. Now let\u0026rsquo;s talk about drainage, roads, and whether these communities will have water and electricity before families move in.\nCredit where due: Housing remains one area where the government is actually building things people can see and touch. Unlike some other promises we could mention.\n📉 OIL PRICE CONCERNS With the situation in Venezuela continuing to evolve (Trump did WHAT to Maduro?), oil analysts are warning that prices could drop significantly. This affects Guyana\u0026rsquo;s revenue projections for Budget 2026.\nThe good news: More FPSOs coming online will increase production volume. The bad news: If you\u0026rsquo;re selling more oil at lower prices, the math gets complicated.\nBottom line: Maybe that $100,000 cash grant should come with a disclaimer: \u0026ldquo;Subject to oil market conditions.\u0026rdquo;\n🏏 SPORTS CORNER Guyana women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team continues to perform well in the CWI Blaze T20 Championships. Captain Shemaine Campbelle scored an unbeaten 50 against Jamaica.\nWest Indies will face Afghanistan in a T20I series in Dubai as both teams tune up for the T20 World Cup starting February 7.\nMeanwhile, the 2026 cycling season kicked off at National Park despite heavy rain, because Guyanese cyclists don\u0026rsquo;t let a little weather stop them.\n📰 QUICK HITS Georgetown Chamber of Commerce commends Budget 2026\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;people-centric\u0026rdquo; approach Region Two Mashramani kicks off with young voices leading the celebrations Stanleytown bridge delays continue causing traffic chaos on the West Bank China-Guyana health partnership to expand with new therapies and obesity programs in 2026 Roraima Airways announces 7% reduction in airfares to rehabilitated hinterland airstrips 🎭 DEM BOYS SEH From Kaieteur News: When the furniture warehouse started blazing, \u0026ldquo;nuff people nearly drop dem phone.\u0026rdquo; The owners took a serious hit, but \u0026ldquo;dem boys seh is only luck\u0026rdquo; that prevented worse.\nTranslation: Fire destroyed a furniture store. Everyone was too busy filming to help.\n📊 TODAY\u0026rsquo;S NUMBERS Metric Number GRA employees fired Several New house lots planned 15,000 New homes planned 8,000 Years since RUSAL left 6 Projected oil price drop $50/barrel Cash grant per adult $100,000 THE BOTTOM LINE It\u0026rsquo;s Friday, Guyana. The government is spending big, RUSAL is coming back, and GRA officers are learning that helping sanctioned people has consequences.\nChristopher Ram wants fiscal discipline. The opposition wants budget consultations. The government wants you to focus on the house lots, not the questions.\nMeanwhile, somewhere in Queens, Uncle Ramesh is preparing his response about why everything is actually fine.\nHave a great weekend! 🇬🇾\nThe Daily Brief: We read the news so you can laugh at it.\nRead all four papers yourself: Guyana Chronicle | Stabroek News | Kaieteur News | Guyana Times\nDISCLAIMER: The Daily Brief is satirical commentary on real news events.

Guyana, what a country.\n🗳️ OPPOSITION LEADER: The \u0026ldquo;Fugitive\u0026rdquo; Wins (Probably) After weeks of international pressure from the US, UK, and Canada, Speaker Nadir finally scheduled the election — while making sure EVERYONE knows how he feels about it.\nWhat Speaker Said Translation \u0026ldquo;International fugitive\u0026rdquo; Not a fan \u0026ldquo;Stain on our Parliament\u0026rdquo; Really not a fan \u0026ldquo;Pablo Escobar reference\u0026rdquo; Okay, we get it \u0026ldquo;Will not pander to threats\u0026rdquo; But here\u0026rsquo;s your election anyway Dr. Leslie Ramsammy drew comparisons to Singapore, where they just STRIPPED an opposition leader of his title for lying under oath. \u0026ldquo;Singapore acted to protect the integrity of its parliament. In Guyana, we are about to do the opposite.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Azruddin says he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ready to represent Guyanese.\u0026rdquo; His extradition hearing resumes February 5th. Scheduling, am I right?\n💰 BUDGET 2026: The Main Event Finance Minister Singh and his team worked \u0026ldquo;late into Sunday night\u0026rdquo; finalizing the budget. What we know:\nPromise Status $100,000 cash grant (18+) ✅ Confirmed Net property tax abolished ✅ Promised Income tax threshold increase ✅ Over 5 years Zero-interest SME loans up to $3M ✅ In manifesto Gas-to-Energy completion ⏳ Late 2026 Dr. Singh\u0026rsquo;s message: \u0026ldquo;Policy, consistency, clarity and continuity.\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: More of the same, but bigger.\nThe 2025 budget was $1.382 trillion. Place your bets on 2026.\n🏨 HOTELS: Four Points by Sheraton Almost Ready President Ali took a \u0026ldquo;guided tour\u0026rdquo; of the Four Points by Sheraton at Caneview Avenue on Saturday night. Because nothing says \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the President\u0026rdquo; like getting private tours of hotels that aren\u0026rsquo;t open yet.\nThe hotel \u0026ldquo;will be opened shortly\u0026rdquo; and will \u0026ldquo;further strengthen our accommodation capacity.\u0026rdquo; At this rate, Guyana will have more hotel rooms than residents who can afford them.\n🏟️ BERBICE: Palmyra Stadium Nearing Completion The Palmyra Multipurpose Stadium is almost ready, and Berbicians are excited.\nFormer West Indies player Devendra Bishoo: \u0026ldquo;This is a game-changer for young people. Such infrastructure was unimaginable during my early playing years.\u0026rdquo;\nThe stadium promises to transform Berbice into \u0026ldquo;a hub for sport, culture, and economic activity.\u0026rdquo; Finally, somewhere for all those cricket arguments to happen in person.\n🏫 TABATINGA SCHOOL: Opposition Says Not Ready APNU MP Sherod Duncan visited the Tabatinga Secondary School construction site and declared it \u0026ldquo;far from operational readiness.\u0026rdquo;\nThe government has promised the school will open. The opposition says it won\u0026rsquo;t. Someone\u0026rsquo;s going to be wrong, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be entertaining either way.\n🩺 HEALTH: Chinese Medical Team Opens Specialized Clinic A Chinese medical team has opened a specialized clinic for metabolic diseases at Georgetown Public Hospital.\nInternational cooperation in action! Or as the conspiracy theorists will say, \u0026ldquo;Chinese infiltration.\u0026rdquo; Take your pick.\n📊 WEEK AHEAD Day What\u0026rsquo;s Happening Monday AM Opposition Leader election Monday PM Budget 2026 presentation February 5 Azruddin\u0026rsquo;s extradition hearing resumes Ongoing Four Points Sheraton opening \u0026ldquo;shortly\u0026rdquo; 💭 THOUGHT FOR THE DAY The opposition is about to elect a man facing US extradition charges as their leader, while the government hands every adult $100,000.\nGuyana 2026: Where the political drama writes itself and the money keeps flowing.\nCritical analysis from all four major papers.

He compared it unfavorably to Singapore, which removed their opposition leader from his post over criminal matters.\n\u0026ldquo;Singapore acted to protect the integrity of its parliament. In Guyana, we are about to do the opposite,\u0026rdquo; Ramsammy noted.\nRights Groups Pile On: The Association of People of African Descent (APAD) has formally registered concerns, calling on Opposition MPs to \u0026ldquo;place country above faction.\u0026rdquo; They pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition participates in several constitutional appointments and democratic oversight functions.\nThe Charges: According to US prosecutors, Mohamed\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise allegedly evaded Guyana\u0026rsquo;s gold export taxes, conspired to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering, smuggled drugs, and omitted more than 10,000 kilograms of gold from declarations — avoiding over $50 million in taxes.\nThe Bottom Line: Monday should be interesting. Very, very interesting.\n🦟 CHIKUNGUNYA ALERT: Suriname Outbreak Has Guyana on Watch Health Minister Dr. Frank Anthony says Guyana is issuing alerts to all health facilities after Suriname confirmed eight cases of chikungunya — and none of those patients traveled overseas.\nThe mosquito-borne disease causes severe body pains and fever. Dr. Anthony says Guyana\u0026rsquo;s surveillance system is \u0026ldquo;fairly robust\u0026rdquo; and hospitals will test for dengue first, then other infections.\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re watching, but please also clean up the stagnant water around your house because we trained the NDCs to fog but\u0026hellip; you know how that goes.\u0026rdquo;\n👩‍💼 WOMEN\u0026rsquo;S CHAMBER: Tackling Care Work, Finance Gaps, and Gender Violence The Women\u0026rsquo;s Chamber of Commerce and Industry Guyana (WCCIG) is expanding its focus beyond traditional business support. Under President Josephine Tapp and VP Shamela John, they\u0026rsquo;re tackling:\nAccess to finance for women entrepreneurs Care work infrastructure (who watches the children while you\u0026rsquo;re building an empire?) Gender-responsive government procurement Gender-based violence The Women Evolve Initiative specifically helps women transitioning from \u0026ldquo;structured employment\u0026rdquo; to business ownership — because apparently lots of women make it to year two or three then exit because nobody taught them how to handle business finances.\nQuote of the Day: \u0026ldquo;A lot of women make it to the second or third year and then exit because they didn\u0026rsquo;t structure their finances.\u0026rdquo;\n✈️ AIRLINES CUTTING HINTERLAND FARES: Progress! Multiple airlines have now announced fare reductions following President Ali\u0026rsquo;s call:\nAirline Reduction Effective Roraima Airways 7% Immediate Trans Guyana Airways 7% January 2026 Jags Aviation TBD February 1, 2026 President Ali\u0026rsquo;s target is 15%, so they\u0026rsquo;re halfway there. Roraima notably applied the reduction to ALL rehabilitated airstrips, not just selected destinations.\nCaptain Gerry Gouveia Jr.: \u0026ldquo;If infrastructure improves, all communities should benefit.\u0026rdquo;\n🚢 ONE FREEDOM CRUISE SHIP: Tourism Minister Takes Test Ride Tourism Minister Susan Rodrigues took a \u0026ldquo;breathtaking journey\u0026rdquo; aboard the One Freedom, Guyana Glory Passenger Cruise Ship across the Demerara River and into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe ship boasts 46 self-contained, double occupancy rooms, a gym, and other attractions.\nTranslation: Guyana is really trying this river tourism thing. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if tourists want to cruise the Demerara as much as they want to see Kaieteur.\n📊 QUICK HITS Crime Stats: Murders UP 11.1% (130 vs 117 in 2024), but overall \u0026ldquo;serious crimes\u0026rdquo; DOWN 25.5%. Make of that what you will.\nTabatinga Secondary School: Opposition MPs visited and said it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;far from operational readiness.\u0026rdquo; Government probably disagrees.\nLaw Year 2026 Opens: AG Nandlall criticized courts for not applying modern legislation; Chancellor George called for honoring judicial financial autonomy provisions.\nSuspected Murder-Suicide: Two guest house employees found dead at Lime Street, Werk-en-Rust. Police investigating.\n🗞️ THE NEWSPAPER WARS CONTINUE Guyana Chronicle: Published a piece calling Stabroek News columnist Bertrand Ramcharran \u0026ldquo;despicable\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;repellent\u0026rdquo; for praising a former Mossad head. Also called the SN\u0026rsquo;s online comment section \u0026ldquo;sycophantic eulogy and psychotic anti-government pyrotechnics.\u0026rdquo;\nStabroek News: Continues to ask why the Speaker took so long to schedule the Opposition Leader vote.\nKaieteur News: Running columns asking if Guyana is a \u0026ldquo;vassal state\u0026rdquo; beholden to the US. Also detailed how the 2016 oil contract allows Exxon to use profits from one field to pay for exploration in others, keeping Guyana\u0026rsquo;s profit share \u0026ldquo;perpetually out of reach.\u0026rdquo;\nGuyana Times: Covering government achievements. Water is also wet.\n💭 FINAL THOUGHT Monday\u0026rsquo;s National Assembly sitting will be historic one way or another. Either Guyana elects a US-sanctioned businessman as Leader of the Opposition, or\u0026hellip; well, there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a Plan B.\nAs Dr. Henry Jeffrey wrote: \u0026ldquo;Incumbents can and do totally ignore the opposition.\u0026rdquo; Which raises the question — does it even matter who leads an opposition that gets ignored anyway?\nSee you Monday for the drama! 🍿\nThe Guyana Daily Brief is satirical commentary.

From Bridgetown to Kingston, Port of Spain to Georgetown — here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s making waves across the region today!\n🇺🇸 US-CARIBBEAN RELATIONS: THE TENSION CONTINUES The Headlines:\nIMF approves $415M emergency assistance for Jamaica Caribbean nations facing stricter US visa scrutiny in 2026 Barbados FM concerned about US military strikes bypassing \u0026ldquo;due process\u0026rdquo; US reaffirms partnership with Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago The Brief: The US and Caribbean relationship looking more complicated than a Port of Spain traffic roundabout!\nJamaica just secured $415 million from the IMF. You know things serious when the IMF is your financial advisor. But hey, at least somebody answering Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s calls!\nMeanwhile, Caribbean nationals facing tighter US visa scrutiny. Birth tourism crackdown, they calling it. So now when pregnant Caribbean women want to visit Disney World, they gon get the third degree at the embassy. \u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rsquo;am, what\u0026rsquo;s your due date? And why exactly do you want to see Mickey Mouse in your third trimester?\u0026rdquo;\nBarbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds watching those US military strikes in the Caribbean Sea and raising eyebrows. \u0026ldquo;Due process,\u0026rdquo; he say. The Americans basically patrolling Caribbean waters like it\u0026rsquo;s their swimming pool, and our ministers can only send strongly worded statements.\nBut Trinidad somehow getting love letters from Trump administration! Kamla Persad-Bissessar and Trump apparently best friends now. Strange bedfellows, but politics make for strange everything these days.\n🇻🇪 VENEZUELA: NEW MANAGEMENT, SAME DRAMA The Headlines:\nVenezuela interim president moves to overhaul oil law US-Venezuela tensions continue The Brief: Venezuela got new management and they already rewriting the oil laws.\nEvery Caribbean nation watching this like hawks. Venezuela change their oil deals, Guyana gon want to renegotiate. Trinidad gon want better gas terms. And the oil companies? They just shuffling lawyers from one country to the next like a Caribbean legal tour.\nThe US invasion (sorry, \u0026ldquo;military operation\u0026rdquo;) aftermath still playing out. Bombs falling in Caracas, the Caribbean calling for \u0026ldquo;dialogue,\u0026rdquo; and everybody pretending this is normal international relations.\nBut you know how Caribbean people stay — we gon watch the drama, make commentary, and still fly through Venezuelan airspace because the tickets cheap.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: WINNING ELECTIONS, NEEDING MONEY The Headlines:\nAndrew Holness wins third consecutive term Jamaica secures $415M IMF emergency assistance Gas prices up in Jamaica The Brief: Andrew Holness just became the first Jamaica Labour Party leader to win THREE terms in a row! Historic!\nOf course, the margin smaller than the last election, but a win is a win. Just like a Jamaican patty with less filling — still a patty!\nBut winning don\u0026rsquo;t pay the bills. That $415 million IMF package shows Jamaica still struggling post-Hurricane Melissa. Climate change hitting the Caribbean different, and our economies built on beaches that keep washing away.\nGas prices up too. Everything up except wages. Classic Caribbean economy vibes.\n🇧🇧 BARBADOS: POLITICS AND RUNNING The Headlines:\nTyra Trotman wins BLP nomination for St Michael Central UK marathon runner launches \u0026ldquo;Project Run 246\u0026rdquo; charity run Barbados Sailing Week 2026 announced The Brief: Barbados Labour Party nomination battles heating up! Lawyer Tyra Trotman defeated Dr Lynette Holder for St Michael Central. Legal eagle beats the doctor — sounds like the start of a bad lawyer joke.\nMeanwhile, some British man running around the entire island for charity. \u0026ldquo;Project Run 246\u0026rdquo; — the area code turned fitness challenge. Bajans watching from their rum shop like \u0026ldquo;He running in THIS heat? For free?!\u0026rdquo;\nSailing Week 2026 announced too. Rich people sailing, regular people watching, rum flowing regardless. The Caribbean economy in action!\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: CRICKET AND POLITICS The Headlines:\nTrinbago Knight Riders win fifth CPL title T\u0026amp;T-US relations reaffirmed amid Venezuela tensions CCJ-CARICOM mess continues The Brief: Trinbago Knight Riders bringing home trophy number FIVE! The CPL trophy more at home in Trinidad than anywhere else. At this point, just rename it the Trinidad Premier League and done!\nBut off the field, Trinidad playing a delicate game. US wants them close because of Venezuela proximity. Trinidad wants US money but doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be seen as a US puppet. Classic Caribbean diplomacy: smile at everybody, commit to nobody, and keep the oil flowing.\nThe CCJ-CARICOM situation still a mess. Jamaica and Bahamas creating confusion, and the rest of the region watching like it\u0026rsquo;s a bad soap opera. We created CARICOM for regional unity and can\u0026rsquo;t even agree on a court. Beautiful.\n🇬🇾 GUYANA: OIL MONEY AND OPPOSITION DRAMA The Headlines:\nBudget 2026 coming Monday Opposition Leader vote finally happening INTERPOL busts gold smuggling ring The Brief: Guyana, Guyana, Guyana. The region\u0026rsquo;s hottest economy and messiest politics!\nBudget 2026 dropping Monday. Every year Guyana\u0026rsquo;s budget bigger than the year before. At this rate, by 2030, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s budget gon be bigger than some Caribbean countries\u0026rsquo; GDP!\nThe Opposition Leader drama would make good Netflix content. A US-indicted businessman about to become Leader of the Opposition while the former opposition party can\u0026rsquo;t decide whether to vote. Exxon watching this and laughing all the way to the bank.\nINTERPOL found a gold smuggling ring. In Guyana. Where gold is everywhere. Truly shocking that people would try to smuggle the thing that literally makes people rich. Next they gon discover water smuggling in Trinidad!\n🏏 CRICKET UPDATE West Indies vs Afghanistan T20 series coming up in Dubai CWI Women\u0026rsquo;s Blaze T20 Championships ongoing Guyana women defeated Jamaica in thriller Cricket is the one thing uniting the Caribbean right now. Everything else is politics, but cricket? That\u0026rsquo;s religion.\n🌊 REGIONAL ROUNDUP Cuba: Still struggling under US sanctions. Power cuts, fuel shortages, and 2026 looking harder than 2025.\nGrenada: Under increased US visa scrutiny but pushing solar energy with Carib Brewery. At least the beer will be green!\nSt. Vincent: Sailing Week countdown begun. Tourism dollars incoming!\nDominican Republic: E-passport rollout happening. Technology reaching the Caribbean!\nUSVI: Refinery cleanup continuing. Environmental sins of the past still paying dividends\u0026hellip; of the bad kind.\n💭 CARIBBEAN THOUGHT OF THE DAY The US putting military ships in our waters, tightening our visas, and demanding \u0026ldquo;partnerships.\u0026rdquo;\nBut when we need climate funding? \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you.\u0026rdquo; When we need debt relief? \u0026ldquo;Have you considered the IMF?\u0026rdquo; When our people need to migrate? \u0026ldquo;Not like that!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Caribbean stuck between superpowers, and we just trying to keep the lights on and the tourists coming.\nBut we Caribbean. We survive hurricanes, colonialism, and each other. We gon survive this too.\nOne Caribbean! 🌴\nThe Caribbean Daily Brief: Because regional news matters, and somebody has to read all these different newspapers!\nSources: Caribbean Today, Caribbean News Global, Nation News (Barbados), Jamaica Observer, Trinidad Express, Kaieteur News, Stabroek News, Guyana Times, Guyana Chronicle\n© 2026 The Guyana Brief.

Peak diplomatic non-commitment.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like he targeted us. I think he was simply expressing his opinion which he has a right to do,\u0026rdquo; Theriot told reporters on Thursday.\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re staying out of this one.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Speaker, you\u0026rsquo;ll recall, had defended the 13th Parliament while also taking a subtle jab at some diplomats whose comments he said contributed to perceptions that Parliament was inactive. He thanked the diplomatic community for their historic support of democracy in Guyana, but suggested some positions were \u0026ldquo;misinformed.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Ambassador\u0026rsquo;s response is the diplomatic equivalent of \u0026ldquo;no comment\u0026rdquo; wrapped in a polite smile. She\u0026rsquo;s not agreeing, she\u0026rsquo;s not disagreeing — she\u0026rsquo;s just acknowledging he has a mouth and can use it.\nSmart woman.\n⚠️ APAD: \u0026ldquo;DON\u0026rsquo;T DO IT\u0026rdquo; The Association of People of African Descent (APAD) has joined the growing chorus warning opposition MPs against electing Azruddin Mohamed as Opposition Leader.\nIn a statement released today, APAD noted that Mohamed \u0026ldquo;is the subject of criminal charges in the United States, including allegations relating to gold smuggling and tax evasion.\u0026rdquo;\nTheir key argument? The Leader of the Opposition isn\u0026rsquo;t just a party position — it\u0026rsquo;s a constitutional office with real power over appointments and democratic oversight.\n\u0026ldquo;Guyana is at a pivotal moment in its history,\u0026rdquo; APAD wrote. \u0026ldquo;Decisions taken now must reinforce that forward trajectory, not cast uncertainty over it.\u0026rdquo;\nThey urged opposition MPs to \u0026ldquo;place country above faction, and long-term national interest above short-term political convenience.\u0026rdquo;\nThe scorecard so far:\nSpeaker Nadir: Don\u0026rsquo;t do it Kit Nascimento: Don\u0026rsquo;t do it Shurwayne Holder: Don\u0026rsquo;t do it APAD: Don\u0026rsquo;t do it WIN: fingers in ears \u0026ldquo;LA LA LA CAN\u0026rsquo;T HEAR YOU\u0026rdquo; The opposition MPs are scheduled to meet Monday to elect their leader. Stay tuned.\n🚢 MINISTER TAKES A CRUISE (FOR WORK, ALLEGEDLY) Minister of Tourism Susan Rodrigues had a rough Wednesday — she had to take a cruise on the Demerara River and out into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe \u0026ldquo;One Freedom\u0026rdquo; — also known as the Guyana Glory Passenger Cruise Ship — was the vessel in question. The Ministry says Rodrigues was conducting a \u0026ldquo;preliminary assessment\u0026rdquo; to explore opportunities for river-based tourism.\nThe ship\u0026rsquo;s specs:\n46 self-contained, double-occupancy rooms Full-service kitchen and bar Gym Open deck space Atlantic Ocean access The engagement focused on packaging river tourism experiences and connecting travel trade with local tour operators.\nLook, if someone has to test whether cruise ships on the Demerara River are viable tourism products, it might as well be the Tourism Minister. That\u0026rsquo;s just good governance.\nSomeone had to sacrifice themselves for the GDP.\n💡 200+ GUYANESE NOW CERTIFIED IN FIBRE OPTICS The Rehoboth Workforce Development Centre, in partnership with the Board of Industrial Training (BIT), has trained over 200 Guyanese in fibre optics since 2022.\nCEO Sherissa Phillips told the Chronicle that the programme addresses a critical skills gap — every major ISP in Guyana now uses fibre-optic infrastructure, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough trained labour to support expansion.\nThe numbers:\n200+ trained since 2022 130 sponsored by BIT USD $1,200 per person for certification 40 contact hours over 4-6 weeks \u0026ldquo;From 2021, the Board of Industrial Training did approximately two cohorts, coming up to about 30 persons being trained,\u0026rdquo; Phillips said. \u0026ldquo;Fast forward to 2026, we would have trained a total of 130 persons in partnership with BIT.\u0026rdquo;\nThe centre plans to expand into other technical training areas as Guyana\u0026rsquo;s development continues.\nFinally, people who can fix the internet when it goes down at 8pm on a Friday.\n🏫 OPPOSITION VISITS SCHOOL, FINDS 4 WORKERS APNU and WIN MPs visited the Tabatinga Secondary School construction site and found\u0026hellip; four workers.\nThe $182 million project, awarded to QA Civil Works in October 2024, was supposed to help with overcrowding at St. Ignatius Secondary School. But according to APNU MP Sherod Duncan, the school is \u0026ldquo;far from operational readiness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Roofing and flooring works were incomplete, key internal finishes remained outstanding, and only four workmen were observed on site,\u0026rdquo; Duncan reported.\nThe opposition is questioning \u0026ldquo;project pacing, supervision, and the realism of the stated completion timeline.\u0026rdquo;\nThe contractor has previously cited challenges including adverse weather, complex soil type, and difficulties transporting materials to the region.\nWIN also noted the access road to the school remains unpaved, causing excessive dust — and this road also serves as the main access to the Rupununi Rodeo Grounds.\nFour workers for a $182M project. At that rate, the building will be ready just in time for the students\u0026rsquo; grandchildren.\n📊 QUICK HITS Bayrock Stadium opens January 31: The long-awaited $179M track and field facility in Linden is finally ready. Sports Ministers Ramson and Jacobs inspected the site last weekend. Features include a synthetic track, football field, and spectator stands.\nWest Indies vs Afghanistan: CWI announced a 16-member squad for the three-match T20I series in Dubai, tuning up for the February 7 World Cup.\nChina-Guyana Friendship Park: The project near the new Demerara Harbour Bridge is now expected to complete by January 26. Features include a children\u0026rsquo;s play zone, trampoline area, outdoor theatre, and sports courts.\n🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE The US Ambassador is staying diplomatically neutral on Parliament drama. APAD is warning against electing a US-indicted leader. The Tourism Minister is cruising (for research). And somewhere in Tabatinga, four brave workers are building an entire secondary school.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Friday in Guyana, and we\u0026rsquo;re heading into the weekend with the opposition leader question still unresolved. Monday\u0026rsquo;s meeting should be interesting.\nHave a good weekend.

I think he was simply expressing his opinion which he has a right to do.\u0026rdquo;\nTHIS IS HOW DIPLOMACY SUPPOSED TO WORK!\nShe not jumping in we business. She not taking sides. She acknowledging that the Speaker is a grown man with a constitutional role who can speak his mind.\nYou know what some people wanted her to say? They wanted her to criticize the Speaker. They wanted international pressure. They wanted the US to interfere in we Parliament business.\nBut Ambassador Theriot too smart for that. She know Guyana is a sovereign nation. She know we have we own democratic processes. And she respectful enough to stay out of it.\nMe nephew ask me: \u0026ldquo;Uncle, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t support the Speaker either!\u0026rdquo;\nBoy, that\u0026rsquo;s the POINT. She not supposed to support OR oppose. She supposed to respect that Guyana handle Guyana business. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what she doing.\nClassy. Professional.

APAD. Saying this.\nThey talking about constitutional responsibility. They talking about \u0026ldquo;long-term national interest.\u0026rdquo; They talking about Guyana\u0026rsquo;s forward trajectory.\nThis is NOT a PPP statement. This is NOT a government position.

For once, put Guyana first.\n🚢 RIVER CRUISES = REAL TOURISM DEVELOPMENT Minister Rodrigues take a cruise on the Demerara River and people want to make joke?\nLet me explain something to the critics: THIS IS WHAT TOURISM DIVERSIFICATION LOOK LIKE.\nThe \u0026ldquo;One Freedom\u0026rdquo; cruise ship got:\n46 rooms with their own bathroom A gym Full kitchen and bar Atlantic Ocean access You know what this mean? It mean Guyana moving from \u0026ldquo;you can see Kaieteur and go home\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;you can have a full tourism experience.\u0026rdquo;\nRiver cruises is BIG BUSINESS in places like the Amazon, the Nile, the Mekong. Why not the Demerara? Why not the Essequibo? We got some of the most untouched riverways in the world!\nMe wife ask me: \u0026ldquo;But Ramesh, you think people coming to Guyana for cruise?\u0026rdquo;\nListen, five years ago nobody was thinking about Guyana as eco-tourism destination. Now we winning international awards. Five years ago nobody was thinking about Georgetown as conference destination. Now we hosting CARICOM and international meetings.\nThings CHANGE when you INVEST in development. The Minister doing her job — assessing opportunities, building partnerships, diversifying the product.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s called vision. Try it sometime.\n💡 FIBRE OPTICS TRAINING = JOBS 200 Guyanese trained in fibre optics. 130 sponsored by the government through BIT.\nYou know what this is? This is the government INVESTING in the workforce for the new economy.\nEvery ISP need fibre optic technicians. The oil and gas sector need them. The tech sector need them. And now we have 200 certified Guyanese ready to fill those jobs.\nThis is how you do it:\nIdentify the skills gap Partner with training providers SPONSOR the training for Guyanese Watch the workforce grow Not everything need to be a big headline. Sometimes development is 30 people at a time getting certified, going out, getting jobs, supporting their families.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s REAL progress.\n🏫 ABOUT THAT SCHOOL\u0026hellip; Yes, the opposition went to Tabatinga and found four workers. You know what else in Tabatinga? A school being built where there wasn\u0026rsquo;t one before.\nI not saying the construction pace good. I not saying they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ask questions. But let\u0026rsquo;s remember:\nThis is hinterland construction Materials have to be transported to Region 9 Soil conditions are challenging Weather is unpredictable The contractor explained the challenges. The government said they monitoring. The school will get built.\nYou know what the opposition DIDN\u0026rsquo;T have between 2015-2020? A $182 million secondary school project for Tabatinga. So yes, ask questions about the pace. But don\u0026rsquo;t forget who actually putting the money there.\n🎯 UNCLE RAMESH BOTTOM LINE This weekend, I grateful for:\n✅ An American Ambassador who respect Guyana sovereignty\n✅ Civil society groups putting country over party\n✅ A government diversifying tourism with river cruises\n✅ 200 young Guyanese with new technical certifications\n✅ Infrastructure projects happening even in the hinterland\nIs everything perfect?

Another day, another round of selective outrage from the critics. But Uncle Ramesh is here to provide some perspective for my fellow Guyanese overseas who want to understand what\u0026rsquo;s REALLY happening back home.\n🗳️ ON THE OPPOSITION LEADER SITUATION So the Speaker finally announced a meeting for Monday to elect the Opposition Leader. Good! But let\u0026rsquo;s be clear about something — the GOVERNMENT didn\u0026rsquo;t cause this delay.\nThe opposition parties have been fighting among themselves for THREE MONTHS. APNU and WIN can\u0026rsquo;t even agree to meet each other! Now they want to blame the government?\nThe Speaker has now set a date. Monday, January 26. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the opposition can actually show up and do their constitutional duty. But somehow, I suspect they\u0026rsquo;ll find something else to complain about.\nMy cousin Ravi from Liberty Avenue says: \u0026ldquo;But Ramesh, the government should have pushed for this sooner!\u0026rdquo;\nRavi, the government has NO ROLE in selecting the Opposition Leader. That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point! The opposition needs to get their own house in order. This government is busy actually running the country — building roads, hospitals, and schools — while the opposition is busy fighting with each other.\n🚔 ON THE POLICE ACADEMY ALLEGATIONS This is serious, and the government is treating it seriously. Within HOURS of receiving the report, the Ministry of Home Affairs directed the Criminal Investigation Department and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate.\nThis is what accountability looks like. The government said clearly: \u0026ldquo;Any individual—regardless of rank, position, or tenure—found to have engaged in wrongdoing will be charged and held fully accountable.\u0026rdquo;\nNo cover-ups. No delays. No excuses. Investigation launched immediately.\nCompare this to previous administrations where allegations would be swept under the rug. This government acts. If anyone is guilty, they will face justice.\n🗑️ ON GEORGETOWN: LET\u0026rsquo;S TALK ABOUT WHO\u0026rsquo;S REALLY RESPONSIBLE Ah, Georgetown. The critics want to blame the government for the garbage situation. But let me ask you something: WHO is responsible for solid waste management in Georgetown?\nThe answer: THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.\nAnd who is the Mayor? Alfred Mentore of APNU.\nMinister Manickchand called a meeting to help resolve the crisis. What did the Mayor do? He BACKED OUT. The APNU councillors got phone calls and \u0026ldquo;hurriedly left the compound.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Minister then met DIRECTLY with the garbage collectors and discovered the real problem — City Hall hasn\u0026rsquo;t been paying them for MONTHS, even though the funds are available!\nSo let me get this straight:\nCity Hall has the money City Hall isn\u0026rsquo;t paying the contractors The garbage piles up And somehow this is the government\u0026rsquo;s fault? The Minister is now working directly with the contractors to solve the problem that City Hall CREATED. That\u0026rsquo;s leadership. That\u0026rsquo;s stepping in when local officials fail.\nMy niece Shanti from Richmond Hill says: \u0026ldquo;But isn\u0026rsquo;t City Hall starved of funds?\u0026rdquo;\nShanti, City Hall receives a subvention from central government AND collects rates and taxes. The money is there. The management is the problem. This government even DONATED new garbage bins to Georgetown! At some point, City Hall has to do its job.\n⚖️ ON THE TSC APPOINTMENT APNU is challenging the Teaching Service Commission appointments, claiming they\u0026rsquo;re unconstitutional because there\u0026rsquo;s no Opposition Leader.\nBut wait — WHO is responsible for the delay in appointing an Opposition Leader? The opposition parties themselves!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t obstruct the constitutional process for three months and then complain when the government continues to function. Should the entire education system grind to a halt because the opposition can\u0026rsquo;t agree on a leader?\nThe government is doing its job. Teachers need to be appointed, promoted, and managed. The TSC is necessary for this. Life goes on, whether the opposition gets its act together or not.\n🏫 ON HOSORORO SECONDARY SCHOOL Here\u0026rsquo;s a story the critics won\u0026rsquo;t highlight: the Hosororo Secondary School in Region One opened this week, serving nearly 500 hinterland students with modern facilities and its own power generation system.\nTHIS is what the government is doing while the critics complain. Building schools. Creating opportunities. Bringing education to remote communities.\nBut you won\u0026rsquo;t see that on the front page, will you? Good news doesn\u0026rsquo;t sell papers.\n💪 ON GUYANA\u0026rsquo;S PROGRESS While the opposition fights among themselves and the critics look for problems, this government continues to deliver:\nGas-to-Energy project progressing on schedule New schools opening in hinterland communities Immediate action on Police Academy allegations Direct intervention to solve Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s garbage crisis Infrastructure being built across the country The diaspora sees it. When we visit home, we see the cranes, the construction, the development. We see a country being transformed.\n🎯 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S FINAL WORD The opposition can\u0026rsquo;t agree among themselves. The Mayor of Georgetown won\u0026rsquo;t show up to meetings. Critics want to blame the government for everything.\nBut facts are facts:\nWhat Critics Say What Actually Happened Government blocking Opposition Leader Opposition parties fighting each other Government responsible for Georgetown mess City Hall not paying contractors Government ignoring Police Academy issue Investigation launched within hours Schools not being built Hosororo Secondary opened this week The noise is loud, but the progress is real.\nUntil next time, this is Uncle Ramesh from Queens, reminding you: Look past the politics, see the progress! 🇬🇾\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing the views of a pro-government diaspora Guyanese.

Reading the news so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\n🗣 THE BIG STORY: Opposition Leader Vote Finally Scheduled Speaker Calls Meeting, Then Calls Candidate a Fugitive\nAfter weeks of constitutional hand-wringing, Speaker Manzoor Nadir has reluctantly announced that opposition MPs will meet Monday, January 26th at 10 AM to elect a Leader of the Opposition.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets spicy: while making the announcement, Nadir basically called the presumptive winner - WIN Leader Azruddin Mohamed - an \u0026ldquo;international fugitive\u0026rdquo; facing US extradition. He then asked everyone to preserve \u0026ldquo;the dignity of the house\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the sanctity\u0026rdquo; of the responsibility.\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m legally required to do this, but I want everyone to know I\u0026rsquo;m unhappy about it.\u0026rdquo;\nWIN holds 16 of 29 opposition seats, so unless APNU pulls off a miracle coalition, Mohamed is your next Opposition Leader.

GUYSOL officials promised 15MW of power, lower electricity costs, and reduced government subsidies.\nEven APNU MP Sharma Solomon showed up and said nice things. When the opposition compliments a government project, you know either: a) The project is genuinely good, or b) It\u0026rsquo;s election season\nConstruction starts Q1 2026, wrapping up Q1 2027.

Non-essential city staff are being reassigned to cleanup duty.\nLocal Government Minister Priya Manickchand responded on Tuesday: \u0026ldquo;You will see relief.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen? How? From where? Details were apparently not essential. But relief is coming. Soon.

Ah, another day, another set of headlines from Guyana that the critics want to twist into something negative. But Uncle Ramesh here to set the record straight for all my fellow Guyanese overseas who want to understand what\u0026rsquo;s REALLY happening in we homeland.\n💰 ON CASH GRANTS: RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP So the President said cash grants are \u0026ldquo;not sustainable,\u0026rdquo; and suddenly everybody vex? Let me ask you something: which responsible government just keeps handing out money without a plan?\nYou know what ISN\u0026rsquo;T sustainable? The way the APNU+AFC coalition ran the economy into the ground. You know what IS sustainable? Investing in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and REAL development that creates jobs and opportunities.\nThe President is thinking LONG TERM. He\u0026rsquo;s not trying to win popularity contests — he\u0026rsquo;s trying to build a nation. Some of you want the government to hand out fish every day. This government teaching people to fish AND building the fish processing plant AND connecting it to the deep-water port.\nMy cousin Suresh from Richmond Hill says: \u0026ldquo;Ramesh, but they promised cash grants!\u0026rdquo;\nSuresh, they also promised transformation, and look — Gas-to-Energy coming online, new hospitals, schools, roads everywhere. You want $100,000 in your hand or you want a country where your grandchildren can actually live and prosper?\n🏙️ ON GEORGETOWN: FINALLY SOMEONE SAYING THE TRUTH Minister Manickchand called Georgetown \u0026ldquo;unacceptable.\u0026rdquo; You know who should be embarrassed? CITY HALL. Not the government.\nThe PPP/C government has been building world-class infrastructure across the country — new highways, new bridges, new everything. Meanwhile, City Hall can\u0026rsquo;t even collect garbage properly.\nThe Minister is doing her job — holding local government accountable. This is what good governance looks like. She\u0026rsquo;s not making excuses. She\u0026rsquo;s saying \u0026ldquo;fix it or explain yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nBut watch how the critics will spin this: \u0026ldquo;Government attacking City Hall!\u0026rdquo; No, no, no. Government is HELPING City Hall by telling them the truth. Sometimes you need tough love.\n👩‍🏫 ON TEACHERS: THE FACTS MATTER The GTU wants a meeting? The Teaching Service Commission has been reconstituted. The 2024-2026 salary agreement is in place — 27% increase over three years! Teachers are getting degrees paid for through GOAL. Remote area incentives increased by 156%.\nBut the GTU president is also an opposition politician. So forgive the government if they\u0026rsquo;re cautious about mixing education policy with political grandstanding.\nThe teachers will get their promotions. The process is moving. Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day, and neither was a modern education system.\n⛽ ON GAS-TO-ENERGY: PROGRESS IS PROGRESS The critics laugh because \u0026ldquo;control rooms arrived.\u0026rdquo; You know what? That IS progress. That IS a milestone.\nDo you know how complex this project is? We\u0026rsquo;re talking about bringing natural gas from offshore, through a pipeline, to a power plant that will cut electricity costs for every single Guyanese. This is generational transformation.\nEvery piece of equipment that arrives is another step closer. By the end of 2026, Guyanese will have reliable, affordable power. The same critics who laughed will be the first ones to enjoy cheaper electricity bills.\n🏥 ON THE HOSPITAL TRAGEDY This is a genuine tragedy, and my heart goes out to the family. The hospital is investigating, as they should.\nBut let me remind everyone: this same government launched the National Electronic Health Record System just days ago. They\u0026rsquo;re modernizing healthcare across the country. Mental health services are being expanded. The suicide prevention hotline (915) is available.\nOne tragic incident doesn\u0026rsquo;t define an entire healthcare system that is being transformed and improved every single day.\n🚢 ON THE NEW VESSEL A brand new ship from Greece to serve Region One! Air-conditioned, modern, safe. This is what investment in the hinterland looks like.\nThe APNU+AFC talked about hinterland development. The PPP/C is DOING hinterland development. New roads, new boats, new schools, new opportunities.\n🗳️ ON THE OPPOSITION LEADER SITUATION You want to know why there\u0026rsquo;s no Opposition Leader? Ask the opposition! They can\u0026rsquo;t even agree among themselves who should lead.\nThe government has said clearly — this is a parliamentary matter. The Speaker will handle it according to the Constitution. But the opposition parties are fighting each other while trying to blame the government.\nMaybe if they spent less time writing letters to newspapers and more time getting their house in order, they\u0026rsquo;d have a leader by now.\n📊 ON INFLATION Yes, food prices have increased. You know what else increased? Minimum wage. Public sector salaries. Cash grants (when they were given). Old age pension.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s be real — inflation is a GLOBAL phenomenon. You think groceries are cheaper here in New York? Everywhere in the world prices went up after COVID. The difference is, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s economy is GROWING while others are stagnating.\nThe government is working on it. Local content requirements, support for farmers, new agricultural initiatives. Solutions take time.\n🎯 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S FINAL WORD Every week, the critics find something new to complain about. Cash grants not sustainable? Complaint. Georgetown dirty? Blame government (not City Hall). Teachers want faster promotions? Government\u0026rsquo;s fault.\nMeanwhile, this government is:\nBuilding a Gas-to-Energy plant Constructing a new Demerara River bridge Modernizing hospitals with electronic records Bringing new vessels for hinterland communities Paving roads across the country Creating jobs and opportunities The diaspora sees it. When we visit home, we see the transformation with our own eyes. Don\u0026rsquo;t let the negativity blind you to the progress.\nGuyana is rising. Whether the critics like it or not.\nUntil next time, this is Uncle Ramesh from Queens, reminding you: Don\u0026rsquo;t believe the hype, believe the progress! 🇬🇾\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing the views of a pro-government diaspora Guyanese. His opinions are satirical commentary and do not represent any real individual or official government position.\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-20-uncle-ramesh/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom Queens, New York — Where we understand fiscal responsibility\u003c/em\u003e 🇬🇾🗽\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"greetings-from-the-diaspora\"\u003eGreetings from the Diaspora!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, another day, another set of headlines from Guyana that the critics want to twist into something negative.

We read the news so you can laugh at it!\n🎯 The Big Story: Former Finance Minister Finally Says What We All Knew Former Finance Minister Winston Jordan has officially admitted what your taxi driver, your auntie, and every rum shop philosopher has been saying for years: Guyana was exploited by Exxon during the 2016 oil contract negotiations.\nIn a recent live broadcast, Jordan explained the circumstances: Venezuela was threatening with Essequibo claims, the rice and sugar industries were failing, and the government needed money to fight the border case at the ICJ.\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;We were desperate, they knew we were desperate, and they took full advantage.\u0026rdquo;\nJordan also revealed that Guyana signed away 600 blocks instead of the industry-standard 60. Yes, you read that right. Ten times more than normal.\nThe opposition is using this to slam the PPP for not renegotiating. The PPP is using this to slam the APNU+AFC for signing the deal in the first place. Meanwhile, Exxon is quietly pumping oil and laughing all the way to the bank.\n🛡️ Border Watch: PM Says We\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;Vigilant\u0026rdquo; After Venezuela Situation Prime Minister Mark Phillips announced that Guyana has strengthened border defences following the recent\u0026hellip; events\u0026hellip; in Venezuela. You know, the ones involving U.S. forces, pre-dawn raids, and the capture of Nicolás Maduro.\nThe PM said GDF troops are \u0026ldquo;permanently deployed\u0026rdquo; along borders with Venezuela, Suriname, and Brazil, and are now in a \u0026ldquo;heightened state of readiness.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat this means: More soldiers watching the jungle. More vigilance. More mosquito bites for our brave troops.\nPhillips also visited Region One to meet with defence officials and residents. Nothing says \u0026ldquo;everything is fine\u0026rdquo; like the Prime Minister personally checking the borders.\n🏗️ Infrastructure Update: Moleson Creek Road Moving, Schools\u0026hellip; Not So Much Good News: The Moleson Creek to Eldorado Road project in Region Six is \u0026ldquo;gaining momentum.\u0026rdquo; Minister Ramraj says it will unlock thousands of acres of farmland and connect remote riverain communities to coastal markets.\nTranslation: More roads in the jungle. Progress!\nLess Good News: Opposition MP Sherod Duncan visited two hinterland school projects in Region Nine and expressed \u0026ldquo;concerns\u0026rdquo; about progress. The $215 million Nappi Secondary School and the $182 million Tabatinga New Secondary School apparently aren\u0026rsquo;t moving as fast as promised.\nDuncan\u0026rsquo;s assessment: The projects meant to accommodate 300+ students aren\u0026rsquo;t on track.\nGovernment\u0026rsquo;s likely response: \u0026ldquo;The opposition is being negative as usual.\u0026rdquo;\n🗳️ The Leader of Opposition Saga Continues Trade unionist Lincoln Lewis has renewed calls for Parliament to elect an Opposition Leader, saying the process should have been completed \u0026ldquo;from the very first sitting of the National Assembly.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Dr. Henry Jeffrey wrote a whole column explaining why the PPP is \u0026ldquo;dragging its feet\u0026rdquo; on appointing Azruddin Mohamed (whose party WIN is now the largest opposition party).\nLetters to the editor are asking why the Speaker hasn\u0026rsquo;t convened the meeting as constitutionally required.\nThe score so far:\nDays without Opposition Leader: Too many to count People demanding action: Everyone Action taken: Zero 💀 Crime Corner: Body Found, Domestic Violence Sentence Tragic discovery: Police found a woman\u0026rsquo;s body in a trench between Barbie Dam and Lamaha Springs, Georgetown. The unidentified woman, believed to be 40-50 years old, was found floating with \u0026ldquo;several visible marks.\u0026rdquo; Investigation ongoing.\nJustice served: Dwayne Bishop got 8 months in prison for assaulting his partner Shellon Zanett at a staff party.

He reads the same news and sees something completely different!\n🎯 Finally! Winston Jordan Admits APNU+AFC Messed Up Eh eh! So now Winston Jordan, the former APNU+AFC Finance Minister, finally come out and admit what we been saying all along - THEY signed a bad deal with Exxon!\nNot PPP. Not Jagdeo. Not Ali. THEM.\nJordan himself say Guyana was \u0026ldquo;exploited\u0026rdquo; and they signed away 600 blocks instead of 60. He blaming Venezuela pressure and failing industries, but lemme tell you something - that\u0026rsquo;s called making excuses for incompetence.\nYou know what a competent government woulda do? Get proper legal advice. Hire oil experts. Negotiate harder. But no, they sign anything Exxon put in front of them because they was desperate.\nAnd now these same people want to criticize the PPP for not renegotiating? Bai, you sign the contract! You think Exxon gon tear it up because we ask nice?\nThe PPP doing what it can - maximizing local content, building infrastructure with the revenue, creating jobs. That\u0026rsquo;s how you work with a bad hand you didn\u0026rsquo;t deal yourself.\n🛡️ Border Security: This Is What Real Leadership Looks Like PM Phillips announce troops on \u0026ldquo;heightened readiness\u0026rdquo; at the borders after the Venezuela situation. This is exactly what we need - calm, professional, prepared.\nNo panic. No inflammatory statements. No chest-beating. Just quiet competence.\nThe PM personally went to Region One to assess the situation. He met with defence officials, regional authorities, and residents. That\u0026rsquo;s a leader who takes security seriously but doesn\u0026rsquo;t create hysteria.\nCompare this to how the APNU+AFC handled anything - remember the chaos? The contradictions? The confusion?\nThis government moves different. Professional. Strategic. Ready for anything but not looking for trouble.\n🏗️ Infrastructure Moving: Moleson Creek Road Opening Up Berbice While the opposition busy complaining, the government busy building.\nThe Moleson Creek to Eldorado Road project connecting Crabwood Creek to Orealla to Kwakwani? That\u0026rsquo;s transformation. Thousands of acres of farmland opening up. Farmers getting market access. Remote communities connected.\nMinister Ramraj said it best: \u0026ldquo;This road is opening farm-to-market access and unlocking thousands of acres of land for farmers.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s development. Not talk. Not promises. Actual construction happening right now.\nAnd yes, some school projects in Region Nine moving slower than planned. You know what? Hinterland construction is hard. Getting materials there, weather challenges, logistics. The opposition MP Duncan want to score political points, but the projects still progressing. They\u0026rsquo;ll get done.\n🗳️ Opposition Leader Drama: They Can\u0026rsquo;t Even Organize Themselves Lincoln Lewis and the letter writers demanding the Opposition Leader election. But wait - isn\u0026rsquo;t this an opposition problem?\nThe opposition parties can\u0026rsquo;t even agree among themselves who should lead. WIN, APNU, AFC - they all fighting like crabs in a barrel. And they want blame the government?\nArticle 184 is clear - the non-government members elect the Opposition Leader. The Speaker chairs it. But the opposition members have to actually agree on a candidate first!\nInstead of writing letters to newspapers, maybe they should have a meeting? Just a thought.\nMeanwhile, the government busy governing. Budget consultations happening with the Private Sector Commission, Georgetown Chamber of Commerce, and business groups nationwide. Work continues whether opposition shows up or not.\n🎉 Republic Day Coming: 56 Years of Sovereignty Next month marks 56 years since Guyana became a Republic. Mashramani season approaching!\nThis is what we should be celebrating - our independence, our sovereignty, our progress. Look how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come since 1970. An oil-producing nation. Growing economy. International respect.\nYes, we have challenges. Every country does. But we also have achievements worth celebrating.\nThe government committed to inclusive development, marginalised groups getting support, schools for children with disabilities opening (like the Yas School of Inspiration), solar farms commissioning in Region Two.\nProgress is happening. You just have to open your eyes to see it.\n⚡ What The Brief Didn\u0026rsquo;t Tell You The Real Story What Opposition Won\u0026rsquo;t Admit Jordan confession APNU+AFC signed the bad contract, not PPP Border security Professional response, troops ready, no panic Gas plant deadline extended \u0026ldquo;Strong interest\u0026rdquo; means companies actively preparing bids Four Miles audit Government responding to residents\u0026rsquo; concerns properly School projects Hinterland construction is complex, but progressing 🇬🇾 Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Monday Message Listen, today a former APNU+AFC minister admitted on live broadcast that his government got exploited by Exxon. On live broadcast.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not PPP propaganda. That\u0026rsquo;s not Kaieteur spin. That\u0026rsquo;s their own man saying what happened.\nSo the next time somebody try tell you the PPP responsible for the oil contract, you remind them: Winston Jordan just told you the truth. Finally.\nNow the PPP working with what they inherited - building roads, securing borders, developing the country. That\u0026rsquo;s what good governance looks like.\nIs Monday. The week just starting. The government working.\nAnd somewhere in Berbice, a road crew connecting farmers to markets.\nProgress, baby. Progress. 🇬🇾\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character.

Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News, Demerara Waves\nThe Facts The Absurdity Level Security guards caught with airsoft guns at supermarkets 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Businesses paying for \u0026ldquo;armed security\u0026rdquo; got toy protection 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 One REAL shotgun found - with serial number filed off 😱😱😱😱😱 Police called them \u0026ldquo;8 firearms\u0026rdquo; - only 1 was real 📰💀💀💀 Here\u0026rsquo;s the situation: Police conducted \u0026ldquo;intelligence-led\u0026rdquo; raids in Sophia and Lusignan and discovered that private security companies have been handing guards AIRSOFT GUNS while charging clients for armed protection.\nLet that marinate.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re paying premium rates for an armed guard, feeling safe while you shop for your split peas and tennis rolls, and the man at the door is packing a toy gun that couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop a determined mosquito.\n🎯 THE BREAKDOWN: What Police Found:\n7 airsoft guns (basically fancy Nerf guns) 1 real 12-gauge shotgun with filed-off serial number 2 live rounds of ammunition 4 arrests including the security company owner Demerara Waves had the best headline, calling the police \u0026ldquo;hoodwinked\u0026rdquo; for boasting about seizing \u0026ldquo;8 firearms\u0026rdquo; when experts confirmed seven were literally toy guns.\nThe Kaieteur editorial didn\u0026rsquo;t hold back either, calling it \u0026ldquo;a betrayal of public trust, a deception of clients, and a direct threat to national security.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, TODAY police found ANOTHER security guard at a Plaisance supermarket with an unlicensed 9mm pistol. So we\u0026rsquo;ve gone from toy guns to illegal real guns in 48 hours. Progress?\n☀️ SOLAR FARM COMMISSIONED AT CHARITY Sources: Guyana Chronicle, Stabroek News, Kaieteur News\nUS$8.14M Charity Solar Farm Stats:\nMetric Value Capacity 3 MWp Annual Generation 4,600 MWh CO₂ Offset 3,500 tonnes/year Fuel Cost Savings GY$267 million/year Households Served ~3,500 Battery Storage 2.25 MW The government commissioned the fifth solar farm under the GUYSOL programme at Charity, Essequibo Coast. PM Mark Phillips was there cutting ribbons and talking about \u0026ldquo;major shifts toward solar-powered electricity.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is genuinely good news! Region Two residents will benefit from cleaner, more reliable power.\nBUT WAIT — while the government celebrates solar farms, GPL blackouts remain a national sport. The irony of commissioning solar panels while half of Georgetown plays \u0026ldquo;guess when the current coming back\u0026rdquo; is not lost on us.\nThe programme is funded through the Guyana-Norway partnership (US$83.3 million total) and will eventually deliver 33 MWp of solar capacity across Regions 2, 5, 6, and 10.\n🏦 GBTI LAUNCHES \u0026ldquo;PRIVATE BANKING\u0026rdquo; — Because Regular Banking Wasn\u0026rsquo;t Exclusive Enough Source: Stabroek News, Guyana Chronicle\nGBTI launched its new \u0026ldquo;private banking\u0026rdquo; service yesterday, and President Ali was there to explain that it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;not about stratifying customers or exclusion.\u0026rdquo;\nNarrator: It is absolutely about stratifying customers.\nPrivate banking offers personalized investment advice and \u0026ldquo;stronger relationships\u0026rdquo; with your bank. You know, for when you have so much money that regular banking just doesn\u0026rsquo;t cut it anymore.\nAli described it as \u0026ldquo;a quiet but significant marker on the road of progress.\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;We made a special bank service for rich people and we\u0026rsquo;re calling it progress.\u0026rdquo;\n🏗️ $831 MILLION CAMPBELLVILLE POLYCLINIC TAKING SHAPE Source: Guyana Chronicle\nThe new Campbellville Polyclinic, being built at a cost of $831 million, is coming along nicely. When completed, it will replace the old health centre.\nNo jokes here — this is genuinely needed infrastructure. Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s healthcare facilities have been crying out for modernization for decades.\nOne question though: Can we get an update on that $94 million Day and Night Care Facility at Anna Catherina that was commissioned in August 2025 and is STILL not operational? The one with vegetation growing over the fence? Asking for the parents who were promised childcare.\n🏏 GUYANA WOMEN VS JAMAICA TONIGHT — Redemption Under The Lights!

Captain Shemaine Campbelle will be looking for more consistency from the middle order.\nJamaica is desperate for a win, but they\u0026rsquo;ve been dropping catches like they\u0026rsquo;re allergic to the ball. Stafanie Taylor and Chedean Nation are world-class, but they can\u0026rsquo;t do everything themselves.\nPrediction: Guyana bounces back with a comfortable win. We\u0026rsquo;ve got too much talent to let the title slip away this early.\n📰 QUICK HITS: Other Stories Making Noise Story Source Hot Take Civic \u0026amp; Moral Education now in schools Chronicle Finally teaching children about values — maybe some adults should audit the class 85 land titles issued at Onderneeming Chronicle Housing distribution continues, but utilities remain the eternal struggle Mashramani 2026 kicks off Kaieteur Get ready for costumes, floats, and the annual debate about whether Mash has lost its spirit Trump\u0026rsquo;s Venezuela moves Stabroek Maria Corina Machado still waiting while Trump focuses on oil instead of democracy 13-year-old shot attempting robbery Stabroek A heartbreaking story that raises questions about parenting, poverty, and societal decay US pausing immigrant visas for 75 countries Kaieteur The diaspora just got more complicated 🎤 FINAL THOUGHTS Today\u0026rsquo;s news reminds us that Guyana is a land of contradictions. We\u0026rsquo;re building solar farms while blackouts persist. We\u0026rsquo;re commissioning healthcare facilities while others sit abandoned. We\u0026rsquo;re paying for armed security and getting toy guns.\nBut amidst all this, our women cricketers are fighting for regional glory, and there\u0026rsquo;s something pure about that. Go Guyana! 🏏\nThe toy gun scandal is genuinely concerning though. If security companies are bold enough to pull this scam, what else is happening under our noses? The government needs to crack down hard, or criminals will start treating \u0026ldquo;armed\u0026rdquo; guards like traffic suggestions — completely ignorable.\nStay informed. Stay skeptical. Stay Guyanese.\nThe Daily Brief is your critical lens on Guyanese news.

The Daily Brief wake up this morning and choose negativity AGAIN! Every single day is the same thing — government build something, they complain. Government fix something, they complain. Government breathe, they complain!\nBut me ain\u0026rsquo;t going let them bring down the good vibes on this beautiful Saturday. Let Uncle Ramesh set the record straight for the diaspora who want FACTS, not fiction!\n☀️ SOLAR FARM SUCCESS — BUT BRIEF STILL FINDING PROBLEMS! The government just commissioned a US$8.14 MILLION solar farm at Charity that will benefit over 3,500 households, save GY$267 million per year in fuel costs, and offset 3,500 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually.\nThis is FIFTH solar farm under the GUYSOL programme! FIFTH! In less than three months!\nTotal investment: US$83.3 MILLION in renewable energy!\nAnd what the Daily Brief have to say? \u0026ldquo;BUT BUT BUT blackouts still happening!\u0026rdquo;\nYuh see how these people does operate? The government literally building the solution, step by step, systematically bringing renewable energy online, and them still finding something negative to say.\nLet Me Break It Down For You:\nWhat Government Doing What Brief Ignoring 18 MWp solar capacity now online This takes TIME to build 33 MWp total coming by end of programme Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day Gas-to-Energy project progressing 300 MW coming end of 2026 Amaila Falls Hydro still on agenda Long-term vision, people! By end of 2026, Guyana will have 300 megawatts from gas plus all this solar capacity. But them want miracle overnight? Building energy infrastructure for a developing nation takes YEARS of planning and execution!\nThe PPP/C government doing what no other government did — actually INVESTING in energy solutions instead of just talking!\n🔫 SECURITY ISSUE? GOVERNMENT AND POLICE ACTING SWIFTLY! Now, about this security company with the airsoft guns — yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a problem. Nobody disputing that.\nBUT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED:\n✅ Police conducted intelligence-led operation ✅ Arrests were made immediately ✅ Owner of company in custody ✅ Investigation ongoing ✅ Public informed promptly\nThis is how a functioning government works! When problems arise, you ADDRESS them! You investigate, you arrest, you prosecute!\nThe Daily Brief making it sound like government responsible for what private companies do behind closed doors. Should President Ali personally inspect every security guard holster? Should Brigadier Phillips stand outside every supermarket checking firearms?\nThe police did their job. The system worked. Criminals got caught.\nNEXT!\n🏦 PRIVATE BANKING — ECONOMIC SOPHISTICATION! Oh, so now GBTI launching private banking services is a problem too?\nLet me explain something to the people who never left Guyana: In EVERY developed economy, banks offer different levels of service. When your economy grows, your financial sector MUST grow with it.\nPresident Ali said it perfectly: \u0026ldquo;Private banking is not about stratifying customers or exclusion, it is about meeting different demands in a more sophisticated economy.\u0026rdquo;\nGuyana GDP growing at 14% annually! We have new investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses that need specialized financial services. This is a SIGN OF PROGRESS!\nBut nah, the Daily Brief want to make jokes. \u0026ldquo;Special bank for rich people!\u0026rdquo;\nYou know what happen when rich people and investors CAN\u0026rsquo;T get proper banking services?

Going to serve THOUSANDS of Guyanese!\nAnd what the Brief do? Immediately pivot to \u0026ldquo;but what about the Day and Night Care Facility?\u0026rdquo;\nLet me address this directly: Minister Vindhya Persaud already explained that facility opening \u0026ldquo;cannot be rushed.\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s proper procedures, staffing, licensing — these things take time!\nThe opposition (specifically WIN party) running around taking photos of grass growing on fences and calling it \u0026ldquo;election gimmick.\u0026rdquo; These are the same people who couldn\u0026rsquo;t build a outhouse in their 23 years of coalition governments!\nNow they experts on facility commissioning timelines?\n🏏 CRICKET: WE\u0026rsquo;RE STILL DEFENDING CHAMPIONS! Guyana Women lost ONE match by 7 runs and suddenly the sky falling?\nLet me remind everyone:\n🏆 GUYANA ARE THE DEFENDING T20 BLAZE CHAMPIONS\n🏆 Won the title last year after going UNDEFEATED\n🏆 Won Round 1 against Windward Islands\nOne bad game against Leeward Islands (who are actually playing well this tournament) and people panicking?\nTonight we face Jamaica at 7 PM. Jamaica lost BOTH their matches. Our spinners Ashmini Munisar and Plaffianna Millington have been DOMINANT.\nCaptain Shemaine Campbelle knows what it takes to win. This team has championship DNA.\nMy Prediction: Guyana by 25+ runs. Book it!\n📊 THE REAL PICTURE While the Daily Brief busy making jokes, here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s ACTUALLY happening in Guyana:\nThis Week\u0026rsquo;s Progress:\nAchievement Impact 5th Solar Farm Commissioned 3,500 households benefit GBTI Private Banking Launch Financial sector modernization Campbellville Polyclinic Progress Healthcare infrastructure 85 Land Titles Issued Housing programme continues Civic \u0026amp; Moral Education in Schools Building better citizens Security Company Arrested Law enforcement working Six positive developments in ONE week!

No. Does everything happen overnight? No.\nBut compare where we at today versus 2015-2020 under the coalition. Compare the investment, the infrastructure, the vision, the execution.\nThe Daily Brief can keep making jokes. The people on the ground SEEING the changes. The diaspora SEEING the transformation.\nWhen I go home this Mashramani, I\u0026rsquo;ll be driving on new roads, seeing new buildings, and celebrating with my people. That\u0026rsquo;s what matters.\nTo the Guyana Women\u0026rsquo;s team: Go out there tonight and make us proud! 🏏\nTo President Ali and the PPP/C: Keep building, keep investing, keep ignoring the haters!\nTo my fellow Guyanese in the diaspora: Send home that barrel, call your family, and remember — Guyana on the rise!\nUncle Ramesh writing from Queens, NY — Where we does follow Guyana news religiously and support the homeland always!\n🇬🇾 One Guyana!

Her father drove a taxi. Her mother sold vegetables at the market. They had one dream: their daughter would become a doctor.\nAgainst the Odds The path wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy:\nStudied by kerosene lamp when power was out (which was often) Walked 3 miles to school in Berbice rain Helped her mother at the market before classes Won a scholarship to Queen\u0026rsquo;s College in Georgetown Graduated top of her class at University of Guyana medical school A scholarship to Johns Hopkins came next.

Georgetown, once known for its colonial charm mixed with urban challenges, is undergoing a transformation that would have seemed impossible just five years ago.\nThe Numbers Tell the Story Since 2020, Georgetown has seen:\n40+ new businesses opening on Main Street alone $500 million invested in waterfront development 300% increase in tourism infrastructure 12 new hotels under construction or recently opened Beyond the Statistics But the real story isn\u0026rsquo;t in the numbers—it\u0026rsquo;s in the people.\nRajiv Persaud, who returned from Toronto last year to open a tech startup, puts it simply: \u0026ldquo;I left because I didn\u0026rsquo;t see opportunity. I came back because now I see nothing but opportunity.\u0026rdquo;\nHis company, GuyanaTech Solutions, now employs 45 Guyanese developers, many of whom were considering emigration before finding high-paying tech jobs at home.\nThe Waterfront Renaissance The Demerara River waterfront, once avoided after dark, now bustles with evening activity. New restaurants serve everything from traditional pepperpot to international fusion cuisine. Families stroll along newly lit promenades. Street vendors sell coconut water and plantain chips to office workers on lunch breaks.\n\u0026ldquo;My grandmother remembers when this was the heart of Georgetown,\u0026rdquo; says Michelle Chen, owner of River\u0026rsquo;s Edge Café. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not building something new—we\u0026rsquo;re reclaiming something we lost.\u0026rdquo;\nChallenges Remain Not everything is perfect. Traffic congestion has worsened with prosperity. Housing prices are rising faster than wages for some. The infrastructure upgrades can\u0026rsquo;t keep pace with demand.\nBut these are, as Mayor Patricia Williams notes, \u0026ldquo;the problems of a city that\u0026rsquo;s growing, not dying.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Diaspora Returns Perhaps most telling: the flow is reversing. More Guyanese are returning home than leaving. The \u0026ldquo;brain drain\u0026rdquo; that plagued the nation for decades is becoming a \u0026ldquo;brain gain.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the University of Guyana, Professor David Singh sees it in his classrooms: \u0026ldquo;Students used to ask me how to get into foreign universities.

I laughed.) 😂\nDe REAL Numbers (Not De Comedy Version) What Comedy Crew Said:\n70 potholes reported 2 fixed Success rate: 2.8% Uncle Ramesh = Comedy goldmine What ACTUALLY Happened (After 3 Weeks):\n127 potholes reported (I wasn\u0026rsquo;t done!) 31 ACTUALLY FIXED = 24.4% ✅ 18 scheduled next phase = 14.2% 📅 42 long-term maintenance = 33.1% 🔧 36 still reviewing = 28.3% 🔍 Math check: 24.4% success rate in 3 weeks!\nIs it perfect? NO. Is it better than de ZERO potholes that was getting fix before? ABSOLUTELY YES!\nLet Me Explain De Process (Because Y\u0026rsquo;all Don\u0026rsquo;t Understand) Phase 1: Verification (Days 1-3)\nWhen you report pothole, government not just accepting blindly! Dey checking:\n❓ Is this duplicate? (Remember, LBI pothole got 15 reports!) ❓ Location accurate? ❓ Is it REALLY a pothole or just normal wear? ❓ How severe?\nDe yellow circles?

You want de PAINTER to fill pothole with PAINT?!\u0026rdquo; 😂\nPhase 2: Priority Ranking (Days 4-7)\nMinistry ranking by:\nTraffic volume (busy roads first) Safety risk (near schools/hospitals = priority) Repair efficiency (fix 10 holes in one area vs. 1 hole far away) Available crews and materials This is why some holes get fix quick and others waiting!\nWilar ask me: \u0026ldquo;So de government playing favorites with potholes?\u0026rdquo;\nMe: \u0026ldquo;No, dey playing LOGISTICS! You want dem fix one hole in Berbice today and one hole in Essequibo tomorrow? De FUEL cost alone!\u0026rdquo;\nPhase 3: Actual Repair (Ongoing)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what people DON\u0026rsquo;T understand:\nGovernment CAN\u0026rsquo;T fix 3,847 potholes overnight because:\nLimited asphalt (have to ORDER it!) Limited crews (only so many workers!) Limited budget (oil money not unlimited!) Weather (can\u0026rsquo;t patch in rain!) Traffic management (can\u0026rsquo;t close ALL roads!) Is project management, not magic! 🪄\nDe SUCCESS Story Nobody Talking About!

The Guyanese agronomist now heads this crucial regional agricultural cooperation body, marking another international leadership role for Guyana.\nWhy It Matters: As Guyana expands its agricultural sector beyond oil, having a Guyanese national leading regional agricultural policy could benefit the country\u0026rsquo;s diversification efforts.\n📊 Census Data Sparks Housing Debate The Numbers Don\u0026rsquo;t Add Up: Critics are using the newly released 2022 Census data to challenge the government\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;housing crisis\u0026rdquo; narrative. Between 2012 and 2022:\nPopulation grew by 17.6% Households expanded by 32.9% Building stock surged by 42% The Argument: The country added 92,233 new structures while the population grew by 131,719 people. Those buildings could accommodate nearly 300,000 people—more than twice the actual population increase.\nInfrastructure Reality Check:\nNational electricity demand hit 221 MW, straining GPL Wales Gas-to-Energy project delayed until late 2026 Thousands of allocated house lots lack power, water, or road access The Conclusion: Critics say this reveals \u0026ldquo;overbuilding and a planning crisis,\u0026rdquo; not a housing shortage. Government spending continues on roads and preparatory works that deliver minimal functional improvement.\n⚖️ Law Year Opens with Harsh Words AG Goes Off: Attorney General Anil Nandlall used the opening of Law Year 2026 to blast magistrates\u0026rsquo; courts for failing to apply modern legislation. He didn\u0026rsquo;t hold back on criticizing the failure to implement key laws already on the books.\nActing Chancellor Responds: Roxane George called for honoring constitutional provisions addressing the financial autonomy of the judiciary. Translation: Give us our money and independence.\nThe Pattern: This continues a trend of public finger-pointing between the executive and judiciary rather than quiet reform.\n🔒 Cybercrime Law Under Fire Selective Enforcement Alleged: The arrest of Stanley Basdeo under the Cybercrime Act has sparked accusations of politically motivated prosecution. Critics note:\nBasdeo criticized government over gun license denial Pro-government social media figures using \u0026ldquo;vulgarity, racial invective, and wild accusations\u0026rdquo; face no charges The law appears to target government critics while ignoring supporters The Warning: \u0026ldquo;In every autocratic society, loyalty is temporary and usefulness is transactional. Those applauding state overreach today may soon find themselves the next target.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake: Critics say Guyana is witnessing \u0026ldquo;the erosion of free speech through fear, and the normalization of repression through law.\u0026rdquo;\n🤐 President Silent on Migrant Deal No Comment: President Ali refused to provide details on the arrangement with the US for Guyana to accept third-country nationals, telling reporters to refer to a Foreign Secretary statement that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually exist.\nWhat We Know: Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud previously said the governments are \u0026ldquo;nearing an agreement\u0026rdquo; for Guyana to receive refugees or non-felons, with Georgetown having the right to refuse.\nThe Problem: Major policy decisions affecting the country\u0026rsquo;s demographics and resources being made with minimal public disclosure or consultation.\n📉 Criminal Court Backlog Easing Good News (Sort Of): The January 2026 Demerara Criminal Assizes will hear 126 cases between January and March—a significant reduction from previous years\u0026rsquo; backlogs.\nThe Reality: Among the cases scheduled: the 2012 schoolboy murder, Shonette Dover case, and scores of rape charges. Justice delayed is justice denied, even if the delay is getting shorter.\n🏛️ Parliament Still Paralyzed Still Waiting: The 13th Parliament has met only once since November 3rd. No Leader of the Opposition has been elected. The 2026 budget must be presented, debated, and passed—but how?\nInternational Pressure: EU Ambassador Luca Pierantoni and British High Commissioner Jane Miller are now publicly calling for Parliament to resume and the LOO to be elected \u0026ldquo;without delay.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Irony: Both diplomats sat through a 2.5-hour presidential address to an empty opposition bench without objection. Now they\u0026rsquo;re calling for democratic norms.\n🛩️ Airfare Reductions Continue Good News for Hinterland: Trans Guyana Airways announced a 7% reduction in airfares to all rehabilitated hinterland airstrips, following similar moves by other carriers. Roraima Airways also announced reductions.\nThe Pattern: As infrastructure improves, costs are coming down—showing what happens when you actually complete projects rather than just announce them.\nThe Bottom Line Today\u0026rsquo;s news highlights a troubling pattern: infrastructure overbuilt without supporting utilities, laws selectively enforced against critics, and major policy decisions made behind closed doors. Meanwhile, international voices are finally speaking up about Parliament\u0026rsquo;s dysfunction—after sitting silently through its initial sidelining.\nThe census data is particularly damning: if you\u0026rsquo;re building houses faster than your population is growing, and faster than your utilities can support, you\u0026rsquo;re not solving a housing crisis. You\u0026rsquo;re creating an infrastructure crisis while burning through public funds.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Watch: Will Parliament actually reconvene? Will anyone explain the third-country nationals deal? Will the courts address the cybercrime law\u0026rsquo;s selective enforcement?\nReading the Other Side: Some will argue the census shows visionary planning, that financial reforms will materialize, and that the cybercrime law is working as intended. Read Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s take for that perspective.\nStay skeptical, Guyana. 🇬🇾\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-15-wednesday-brief/","summary":"Muhammad Ibrahim becomes IICA Director-General, census data sparks housing debate, cybercrime law faces criticism, and AG slams courts for ignoring legislation.","title":"🔍 [CRITICAL] Wednesday Brief: Guyanese Takes IICA Helm, Census Controversy, and Cybercrime Crackdown"},{"content":"Uncle Ramesh settles into his chair with the census report and a smile\nBai, Uncle Ramesh See De Vision Now So everybody complaining about de census data, saying government build too much house. Uncle Ramesh was confused at first, but den he think about it proper.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what Uncle Ramesh realize: Between 2012 and 2022:\nPopulation grow by 131,719 people Government build 92,233 new structures Each structure hold about 3.23 people Now de critics say \u0026ldquo;Dat\u0026rsquo;s space for 300,000 people! Dat\u0026rsquo;s TWICE what you need!\u0026rdquo;\nBut Uncle Ramesh ask: You rather government build LESS and den everybody complaining dey can\u0026rsquo;t get house lot? You rather we have ACTUAL housing shortage?\nUncle Ramesh remember de days when people wait 10-15 YEARS for house lot. Now government give out lots like Christmas presents, and people STILL complaining!\nUncle Ramesh translation: Government plan AHEAD instead of reacting AFTER. Dat\u0026rsquo;s called VISION, people!\nDe Infrastructure Will Catch Up Critics saying \u0026ldquo;But de lots ain\u0026rsquo;t got power and water!\u0026rdquo;\nUncle Ramesh say: Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day, and neither is infrastructure!\nDe reality:\nGPL working on expanding capacity Wales Gas-to-Energy coming (yes, it delayed, but it COMING) Water projects ongoing Roads being built You can\u0026rsquo;t install power lines BEFORE you allocate de land. Government doing things in ORDER. First give people de land, den build de infrastructure. Dat\u0026rsquo;s how development works!\nUncle Ramesh notice: When government DON\u0026rsquo;T give out house lots, people complain. When government DO give out house lots, people STILL complain. Can\u0026rsquo;t win!\nFinally Some People Going to Court Uncle Ramesh VERY happy to see de criminal court backlog easing. 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from way more before.\nBig cases finally getting heard:\n2012 schoolboy murder Shonette Dover case Scores of rape charges Uncle Ramesh say: Justice delayed is justice denied, yes. But justice HAPPENING is better than justice NEVER happening. Progress is progress!\nAnd de DPP saying backlog been dropping for FIVE YEARS straight. Dat mean government investment in judiciary WORKING.\nDe AG Got a Point Uncle Ramesh see everybody criticizing AG Nandlall for blasting de magistrates. But Uncle Ramesh ask: If you pass modern laws and courts ain\u0026rsquo;t using them, whose fault is that?\nGovernment pass legislation to help people. Courts supposed to APPLY the legislation. If courts ignoring de laws, somebody need to speak up!\nUncle Ramesh think: Maybe if courts actually USE de laws Parliament pass, AG won\u0026rsquo;t need to publicly remind them. Just saying.\nGuyanese Leading Regional Organizations Muhammad Ibrahim taking over as Director-General of IICA today. Dat\u0026rsquo;s a GUYANESE leading a major regional agricultural body!\nUncle Ramesh remember when Guyana was de poor relative in de Caribbean. Now:\nWe running regional organizations We leading in oil production We fastest-growing economy in de world Uncle Ramesh proud! When last time you see small Guyana punching above its weight like this? Answer: NOW.\nDe Cybercrime Law Working As Intended People crying about Stanley Basdeo getting arrested for cybercrime. Uncle Ramesh say: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t go on social media making wild accusations, attacking people character, spreading misinformation, and den cry \u0026ldquo;free speech!\u0026rdquo; when police knock on you door.\nDe law apply to EVERYBODY. You want to criticize government? Fine! Do it RESPONSIBLY. Don\u0026rsquo;t make up stories, don\u0026rsquo;t defame people, don\u0026rsquo;t spread lies.\nUncle Ramesh notice de same people defending Basdeo would be FIRST to call for jail if somebody attack THEM online. Funny how that works.\nPresident Protecting National Interests Critics vex that President Ali won\u0026rsquo;t give details about de third-country nationals deal. Uncle Ramesh ask: Since when government supposed to negotiate international agreements in PUBLIC?\nYou negotiate in PRIVATE, den announce when deal is DONE. Dat\u0026rsquo;s how diplomacy works! You think USA announce every detail while they negotiating? You think China tweet their strategy?\nUncle Ramesh say: Let de government do their job. When de deal ready, they will announce it. Until den, stop demanding classified information like you work for de State Department.\nAirfares Dropping Because Government Delivered Uncle Ramesh LOVE this one. Government rehabilitate airstrips, and immediately:\nTrans Guyana drop fares 7% Air Services drop fares 9% Roraima drop fares too Dis is de free market RESPONDING to government investment! Government fix de infrastructure, private sector benefit, PEOPLE benefit.\nUncle Ramesh ask de critics: When last time opposition fix a airstrip? Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nParliament Will Resume When Ready EU and UK ambassadors calling for Parliament to resume. Uncle Ramesh think: Mind your business!\nGuyana is a sovereign nation. We will run OUR Parliament on OUR timeline. If we need advice on how to run democracy, Uncle Ramesh will look at countries that DIDN\u0026rsquo;T colonize half de world.\nDe truth: Opposition walking out, not cooperating, playing politics instead of governing. When they ready to behave like adults, Parliament will resume.\nUncle Ramesh notice these same ambassadors quiet when opposition was disrupting Parliament. Now dey want to talk? Please.\nUncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Bottom Line Census show government planning AHEAD with housing (good strategy!). Courts finally clearing backlog after years of government investment (progress!). Guyanese leading regional organizations (national pride!). Airfares dropping because government delivered on infrastructure (results!).\nDe pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing: Government making long-term investments, critics want instant results, and when results COME, critics find something else to complain about.\nUncle Ramesh prefer it this way: Build first, explain later. Results speak louder than press conferences.\nIs everything perfect? No! But show Uncle Ramesh ANY country where everything perfect. Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nUncle Ramesh going back to enjoying he census data. At least when government do math, dey planning for GROWTH instead of DECLINE. Dat\u0026rsquo;s leadership!\n🇬🇾 Keep building, Guyana. De critics will always criticize. De builders will always build.\n*Reading the Other Side: De critics will say government overbuilding, cybercrime law being abused, and Parliament dysfunction. Read de Wednesday Brief for dat perspective if you want to be negative all de time.\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary and don\u0026rsquo;t represent actual persons. But de progress? De progress REAL.*\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-15-uncle-ramesh-take/","summary":"Uncle Ramesh does the math on the census data and discovers the government was actually planning ahead.

Arnos Vale Playing Ground, St. Vincent.\nGuyana Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team faces elimination. They\u0026rsquo;ve posted only 96 runs. The Windward Islands need just 97 to win and have cruised to 78-2 with two overs remaining.\nThe game is over. Except it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIn a stunning display of nerve, skill, and sheer refusal to lose, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s bowlers—led by Plaffiana Millington\u0026rsquo;s ice-cold final over—defend the impossible. The Windward Islands collapse, losing three wickets while adding only 11 runs.\nFinal score: Windward Islands 89-5. Guyana wins by 7 runs, defending their title in the most dramatic fashion possible.\nBack home, a nation erupts. Not just cricket fans—everyone. For once, nobody\u0026rsquo;s arguing about politics.\n🔑 Key Takeaways Guyana\u0026rsquo;s women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team achieved dramatic victory defending 96 runs against Windward Islands Their success symbolizes national unity and possibility in a politically divided country Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket has seen explosive growth since 2019, with Guyana leading regional development Key players like Shabika Gajnabi, Plaffiana Millington, and Ashmini Munisar are inspiring new generations The real victory is changing perceptions about women\u0026rsquo;s sports and creating new role models MORE THAN A GAME To understand why this victory matters so much, you need to understand what cricket means in Guyana.\n\u0026ldquo;Cricket is our cultural language,\u0026rdquo; explains sports journalist Malcolm Walker. \u0026ldquo;In a country divided by politics, race, and geography, cricket is the one conversation everyone participates in equally.\u0026rdquo;\nBut for most of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history, that conversation centered on men\u0026rsquo;s cricket. Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket existed, but in the shadows. Underfunded, under-covered, under-appreciated.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s changing.\nTHE REVOLUTION BEGINS The transformation started in the aftermath of 2019\u0026rsquo;s Cricket World Cup hosted in the Caribbean. Seeing the global growth of women\u0026rsquo;s cricket, Cricket West Indies committed to developing regional women\u0026rsquo;s programs.\nInvestment increased. Training facilities improved. Most importantly, media coverage expanded. \u0026ldquo;We went from being an afterthought to being on the front page,\u0026rdquo; recalls Shemaine Campbelle, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s veteran wicketkeeper-batter.\nThe impact was immediate. By 2022, Guyana had more registered female youth cricketers than any other Caribbean territory.\nTHE 2025 BREAKTHROUGH The 2025 CWI T20 Blaze Championship marked Guyana\u0026rsquo;s ascension to dominance. The team, captained by Shabika Gajnabi, swept through the competition with aggressive batting, disciplined bowling, and field athleticism that redefined expectations.\nThey won convincingly. But more importantly, they did it with style—entertaining cricket that drew crowds and television viewers.\nTHE STARS EMERGE Shabika Gajnabi (Captain): The 27-year-old all-rounder leads with quiet confidence and explosive batting.\nPlaffiana Millington: The spinner who clutched Tuesday\u0026rsquo;s victory is cricket\u0026rsquo;s version of an ice queen—nerveless under pressure.\nAshmini Munisar: The 23-year-old fast bowler brings genuine pace that unsettles batters.\nSheneta Grimmond: The medium-pacer who provides crucial control in the middle overs.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just athletes. They\u0026rsquo;re role models, showing young Guyanese girls that sporting excellence is achievable.\nBEYOND THE BOUNDARY The team\u0026rsquo;s impact extends far beyond cricket statistics. Girls\u0026rsquo; cricket programs have quadrupled since 2023. Corporate sponsors are investing. Even politicians who disagree on everything unite in praising the cricket team.\nTHE CHALLENGES REMAIN Despite progress, challenges persist. Funding gaps remain. Few women can make cricket a full-time career. Media coverage still lags men\u0026rsquo;s games. In some communities, traditional gender norms still discourage girls from sports.\nWHAT IT ALL MEANS Why does this matter? In a country often defined by what divides us, these women provide something increasingly rare: a source of pure, uncomplicated national pride.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just about cricket. It\u0026rsquo;s about possibility. These women prove that Guyanese excellence isn\u0026rsquo;t a myth. With dedication, support, and opportunity, Guyanese women can compete with—and beat—anyone.\nTen-year-old Aliya Singh practices in her Berbice yard every afternoon. \u0026ldquo;I want to be like Plaffiana,\u0026rdquo; she says, grinning. \u0026ldquo;I want to represent Guyana.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the real victory—not just championships won, but dreams unlocked.\nCONCLUSION Share This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like Caribbean Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting …\nFeb 14, 2026 Read more → Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Happy Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, Guyana.

They\u0026rsquo;re defending a vision of Guyana where talent matters more than gender, where excellence is rewarded regardless of tradition, where the next generation has heroes who look like them.\n\u0026ldquo;We play for every Guyanese,\u0026rdquo; Captain Gajnabi said after Tuesday\u0026rsquo;s victory.

But describing it as revelatory makes it sound like we\u0026rsquo;ve been building highways without drainage this whole time.\nMeanwhile, in other infrastructure news:\nThe Linden to Mabura Hill road is 62% complete!

THAT\u0026rsquo;S THE WHOLE POINT!\nYou know why Nandlall had to stand up there and REMIND people that plea-bargaining is MANDATORY? Because for YEARSâ€”under the previous governmentâ€”nobody enforced these modern laws! The legislation was passed but collecting dust!\nThis is EXACTLY what reform looks like:\nIdentifying where system failing Calling it out publicly Demanding accountability Following up with action The Brief making jokes, saying \u0026ldquo;everyone remembered laws exist.\u0026rdquo; No! The AG is doing his JOB by ensuring the judiciary IMPLEMENTS the laws Parliament passed!\nAnd Chancellor George revealing they handled 30,000 criminal cases with staff shortages?

That\u0026rsquo;s the judiciary saying \u0026ldquo;we need help\u0026rdquo; instead of hiding the problems!\nReality Check for The Brief: You can\u0026rsquo;t fix problems you don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge. The 2026 Law Year opening was about HONEST ASSESSMENT, not ceremony!\nRE NOT A JOKE, PEOPLE Ohhhhh, The Brief really showing their ignorance now.\nMaking fun of government apps? Let me EDUCATE you:\nDo you know what these apps represent?\nDirect accountability - You can now DOCUMENT your complaint with timestamp Transparency - Everyone can see response times Data collection - Government can identify problem areas Accessibility - No more driving to Georgetown to file complaint Modern governance - What first-world countries been doing for DECADE The Brief saying \u0026ldquo;What about government WiFi?\u0026rdquo; - THAT\u0026rsquo;S WHY THEY MAKING THE APPS!

Maybe something happen.\nThe new system: App. Receipt. Tracking. Accountability. Follow-up.\nBut sure, make jokes. Stay in 1990s while government trying to bring country to 2026.\nTO HIGHWAYS: RESPECTING THE ENGINEERING The Brief really showed their backside here.\nMaking fun of President Ali for pointing out they draining swamps to build highways? You think that EASY?\nLet me break it down for the smart people making jokes:\nBuilding roads in Guyana involves:\nDealing with water table issues Installing MASSIVE drainage systems Soil stabilization (you can\u0026rsquo;t just pour asphalt on swamp!) Environmental management Coordinating multiple contractors Managing logistics in challenging terrain When President said \u0026ldquo;This shows full understanding of development and urban planning,\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;s RIGHT!

Contractors doing 7km of paving PER MONTH New realistic target is September 2026 Would you rather:\nGovernment lie and say \u0026ldquo;almost done\u0026rdquo; when it not?

But The Brief prefer jokes.\nâš¡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: THE BRIEF DOESN\u0026rsquo;T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS This one REALLY burn me up.\nThe Brief asking \u0026ldquo;Why not solar?\u0026rdquo; and throwing around numbers like they know something.\nLet me educate these comedians:\nWhy Gas-to-Energy makes sense:\nBase Load Power - Solar only works when sun shining! Gas provides 24/7 RELIABLE power We HAVE the gas - It\u0026rsquo;s OUR resource, coming up with oil anyway. Use it or waste it! Job Creation - Long-term technical jobs, not just installation Energy Security - Not dependent on imported solar panels Grid Stability - Consistent output, not weather-dependent Cost Certainty - We control the supply, not subject to global solar panel prices The Brief\u0026rsquo;s solar comparison is MISLEADING:\nArgentina project had Chinese financing (different terms) Philippines has different labor costs Wisconsin? They comparing TROPICAL GUYANA to WISCONSIN? None of these countries had FREE NATURAL GAS coming out the ground! The real question: Why would we NOT use our own natural resource when we can combine it with renewables LATER?\nThe Skeldon Sugar Factory failed because of MIS-MANAGEMENT, not because using local resources is wrong!\nThe Brief making false equivalencies and calling them \u0026ldquo;uncomfortable questions.\u0026rdquo; Noâ€”they just asking UNINFORMED questions!\n: GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT DUE The Brief mocking Dr. Singh for saying population growth \u0026ldquo;vindicates government policy.\u0026rdquo;\nBut IS HE WRONG?\nFacts:\nUnder previous government: MASS EMIGRATION Under current government: People STAYING and RETURNING Oil money ALONE doesn\u0026rsquo;t make country livable (look at some oil-rich countries!)

For a pro-government perspective, see Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s take.\n📊 The Crime Paradox The Numbers: Police report a 25.5% reduction in overall serious crime for 2025, but murders jumped 11.1%—from 117 in 2024 to 130 in 2025.\nWhat Dropped:\nArmed robbery with firearms: down 29.4% Robbery with violence: down 34.1% Burglary: down 70.1% Rape: down 12.6% Larceny from person: down 39.5% The Reality: While property crimes and robberies are down significantly, the murder rate is climbing. That\u0026rsquo;s 13 more families mourning loved ones lost to violence.\nThe Question: What\u0026rsquo;s driving the murder increase when other violent crimes are falling?\n🚁 New $123M Search \u0026amp; Rescue System Big Investment: Guyana launched a modernized Search and Rescue Information and Management System (SARIMS) at Timehri Control Tower, costing $123 million.\nWhat It Does:\nIntegrates all relevant local and international agencies on one platform Provides real-time data for faster decision-making Reduces deployment time for emergencies Houses operations at Georgetown Rescue Coordination Centre Capacity Building: 16 individuals from GCAA, CJIA, GDF, and Ogle Airport trained as search-and-rescue mission coordinators by Canadian experts.\nNext Phase: Government moving forward on a maritime search-and-rescue centre at Kingston to mirror the Timehri system.\nWhy It Matters: With increased flight operations and offshore oil activity, having robust emergency response capacity could save lives.\n🚗 Over 3,100 Traffic Offences in One Week The Carnage: Between January 4-10, police recorded 3,107 traffic violations.\nTop Offenders:\n964 cases of speeding 168 motorcyclists without helmets 62 pillion riders without helmets 151 vehicles in dangerous positions 93 unlighted vehicles (rear) 57 unlighted vehicles (front) The Problem: Nearly 1,000 speeding cases in ONE WEEK shows reckless driving is rampant.\nEast Bank Demerara Focus: Traffic ranks maintaining strong presence during ongoing road works, despite poor road surfaces, limited signage, and inadequate lighting.\nThe Appeal: Police urging motorists to exercise patience, obey traffic laws, and prioritize safety. Enforcement will continue.\n💰 Financial System Reforms \u0026ldquo;In Coming Weeks\u0026rdquo; The Promise: President Ali says government will accelerate modernization of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s financial architecture, including the stock exchange, \u0026ldquo;in the coming weeks.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Rationale: As the economy grows, the existing financial framework must adapt to the expanding scale and complexity.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Included:\nStock market modernization Financial inclusion reforms New investment opportunities for ordinary Guyanese The Reality Check: \u0026ldquo;Coming weeks\u0026rdquo; is government-speak for \u0026ldquo;eventually, maybe.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;ve heard similar promises before. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if this one materializes.\n✈️ More Airfare Reductions The Trend Continues: Trans Guyana Airways announced a 7% reduction in airfares to all rehabilitated hinterland airstrips, following Air Services Limited\u0026rsquo;s 9% reduction.\nThe Trigger: President Ali\u0026rsquo;s call for local operators to reduce fares in recognition of government\u0026rsquo;s airstrip rehabilitation efforts.\nThe Pattern: When infrastructure actually gets completed, costs come down and service improves. Novel concept.\n🚨 Murder-Suicide Investigation Grim Discovery: Police investigating a suspected murder-suicide in Wortmanville that occurred Tuesday morning (Jan 13) between 5:00-8:15 hrs. Firearm, ammunition, knife, and suspected poisonous substance recovered from a guest house.\nThe Silence: Details remain scarce as investigation continues.\n⚖️ Court Backlog Easing Progress Report: January 2026 Demerara Criminal Assizes lists 126 cases for January-March, representing continued decline in backlogs over the past five years.\nMajor Cases: Includes 2012 schoolboy murder, Shonette Dover case, and scores of rape charges.\nThe Reality: Justice delayed is justice denied—even if the delay is getting shorter. Some of these cases have waited over a decade.\n💊 CANU\u0026rsquo;s 2025 Wins Drug War Update: Customs Anti-Narcotic Unit reports operational gains including:\nMajor drug seizures Launch of National Early Warning System for new psychoactive substances 27 training programmes completed Expanded regional and international cooperation The Shift: Moving toward more intelligence-led and coordinated enforcement rather than just interdiction.\n2026 Focus: Enhanced intelligence tools, stronger partnerships, improved operational readiness against evolving trafficking methods and synthetic drugs.\n🏛️ AG Still Criticizing Courts Repeat Performance: Attorney General Anil Nandlall raised \u0026ldquo;serious concerns\u0026rdquo; about magistrates\u0026rsquo; courts failing to apply modern legislation.\nThe Pattern: This is becoming a weekly occurrence. Maybe try working WITH the judiciary instead of publicly blasting them?\nThe Bottom Line Monday\u0026rsquo;s news shows progress in some areas (crime reduction, emergency response, airfare relief) alongside persistent challenges (rising murders, traffic chaos, delayed court cases). The financial system modernization promise joins a long list of \u0026ldquo;coming soon\u0026rdquo; government initiatives.\nMost encouraging: When infrastructure actually gets completed (airstrips), benefits follow (lower fares). Lesson: Finish what you start.\nMost concerning: 3,100 traffic violations in one week and murders up 11% suggest enforcement and prevention need serious attention.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Watch: Will financial reforms actually materialize \u0026ldquo;in coming weeks\u0026rdquo;? Will traffic enforcement reduce the speeding epidemic? Will anyone explain WHY murders are rising?\nReading the Other Side: Some will celebrate the 25% crime reduction, praise the search \u0026amp; rescue investment, and defend traffic enforcement as proof the system works. Read Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s take for that perspective.\nStay alert, Guyana. 🇬🇾\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-13-monday-brief/","summary":"Murders up 11% despite overall crime drop, new $123M search and rescue system launched, over 3,100 traffic offences in one week, and financial system reforms promised.","title":"🔍 [CRITICAL] Monday Brief: Crime Stats, Search \u0026 Rescue Upgrade, and Traffic Chaos"},{"content":"Uncle Ramesh reading the crime statistics with a satisfied nod\nUncle Ramesh offers a pro-government perspective with humor. For critical analysis, see the Monday Brief.\nBai, Uncle Ramesh Know How to Read Statistics So police say crime down 25.5%, and immediately de critics start with \u0026ldquo;But murders up 11%!\u0026rdquo;\nUncle Ramesh say: Let\u0026rsquo;s do de PROPER math, not de cherry-picking math.\nWhat went DOWN in 2025:\nArmed robbery with firearms: down 29.4% Robbery with violence: down 34.1% Burglary: down 70.1% (SEVENTY PERCENT!) Rape: down 12.6% Larceny: down 39.5% Overall serious crime: down 25.5% What went up:\nMurders: up 11.1% (13 more cases) Uncle Ramesh do de math: Dat\u0026rsquo;s HUNDREDS of crimes prevented versus 13 additional murders. Both bad, yes. But you can\u0026rsquo;t ignore de MASSIVE progress because of ONE category.\nUncle Ramesh analogy: If you student bring home report card with A\u0026rsquo;s in 7 subjects and B in one subject, you celebrate de A\u0026rsquo;s WHILE working on de B. You don\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;De whole report card garbage!\u0026rdquo;\nCrime going down 25% is HUGE SUCCESS. Murder rate need work, agreed. But don\u0026rsquo;t let de critics pretend government doing nothing when de evidence RIGHT HERE.\n$123 Million Search \u0026amp; Rescue Is SMART Investment Uncle Ramesh VERY impressed with dis one. Government spend $123 million on new Search and Rescue system, and Uncle Ramesh say FINALLY someone thinking about SAFETY!\nWhy dis important:\nWe got offshore oil operations worth BILLIONS We got increased air traffic (development!) We got hinterland communities that need emergency response When accident happen, MINUTES save lives 16 people trained by Canadian experts. Real-time coordination. Modern technology. Dis is how you run a country in 2026, not 1986!\nAnd Uncle Ramesh ask de critics: When was de last time PREVIOUS government invest in emergency response? Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nCrickets\u0026hellip;\nExactly! Easy to criticize, hard to BUILD.\nTraffic Enforcement Finally WORKING Critics complaining about 3,107 traffic violations in one week. Uncle Ramesh say: GOOD! Catch ALL of them!\nDe numbers:\n964 speeders caught 168 motorcyclists without helmets caught 151 dangerous parking caught Uncle Ramesh ask: You prefer police DON\u0026rsquo;T catch them? You prefer we just let people drive reckless and kill innocent people?\nEnforcement mean police WORKING! If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be part of de 3,107, simple solution: FOLLOW DE LAW!\nUncle Ramesh notice critics never complain when THEY get cut off by speeding car or nearly hit by helmetless biker. But when police actually ENFORCE de law? \u0026ldquo;Oh, harassment!\u0026rdquo;\nPlease.\nPresident Ali Delivering on Financial Reform President say financial system modernization coming \u0026ldquo;in the coming weeks,\u0026rdquo; and critics laughing. Uncle Ramesh say: At least he SAYING it instead of IGNORING it!\nPrevious government: Promised things, delivered nothing.\nCurrent government: Promise things, sometimes take longer than expected, but DELIVER.\nUncle Ramesh prefer slow progress over NO progress. Stock market modernization, financial inclusion, investment opportunities for ordinary Guyanese—all GOOD things dat previous government never even MENTIONED.\nUncle Ramesh prediction: When it happen, same critics will say \u0026ldquo;Took too long!\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Thank you.\u0026rdquo; Watch.\nAirfare Reduction Shows Government Strategy WORKING Uncle Ramesh LOVE dis success story:\nGovernment rehabilitate airstrips (COMPLETED!) President call for fare reductions Trans Guyana drop 7%, Air Services drop 9% Dis is RESULTS! Government invest in infrastructure, private sector respond, PEOPLE benefit.\nUncle Ramesh ask: When opposition was in power, airfares went UP or DOWN? Uncle Ramesh remember airfares going UP because airstrips falling apart!\nCause and effect: Good government policy = Better service + Lower prices.\nUncle Ramesh wish critics would acknowledge SUCCESS when dey see it instead of always looking for problems.\nCANU Doing Excellent Work Customs Anti-Narcotic Unit report for 2025 show:\nMajor drug seizures New Early Warning System launched 27 training programmes completed Enhanced regional cooperation Uncle Ramesh proud! While some countries becoming transit points for drugs, Guyana fighting BACK with intelligence, training, and modern systems.\nCritics quiet about dis one because dey can\u0026rsquo;t find nothing to complain about. When government doing something RIGHT, suddenly nobody want to talk about it.\nCourt Backlog Easing After YEARS of Investment 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from HUNDREDS before. DPP say backlog declining for FIVE YEARS straight.\nUncle Ramesh translation: Government been investing in judiciary CONSISTENTLY, and results SHOWING.\nYes, some cases still waiting long time. But PROGRESS is PROGRESS. You don\u0026rsquo;t fix decades of backlog overnight, but you KEEP WORKING at it until it fixed.\nCritics want instant results. Uncle Ramesh understand PROCESS.\nUncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Bottom Line Crime down 25% overall (massive success!). $123M invested in emergency response (smart planning!). Traffic enforcement catching violators (law and order!). Airfares dropping because infrastructure delivered (results!). CANU fighting drugs effectively (national security!). Court backlog shrinking (justice improving!).\nDe pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing: Government making strategic investments, delivering results, and improving systems. Critics focusing on de 5% dat still need work while ignoring de 95% dat\u0026rsquo;s WORKING.\nUncle Ramesh prefer it this way: Acknowledge progress while working on challenges. Celebrate success while addressing problems.\nIs everything perfect? No! But Uncle Ramesh ask: Show me de perfect country!\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nUncle Ramesh going to enjoy he safer streets (crime down 25%!), knowing dat if he have emergency, $123M search and rescue system got he back. Dat\u0026rsquo;s called PROGRESS, people!\n🇬🇾 Keep moving forward, Guyana. De numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie—only de critics do.\n*Reading the Other Side: De critics will focus on murders being up and say all de progress ain\u0026rsquo;t real. Read de Monday Brief for dat doom and gloom perspective.\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary.

Shocking, we know.\nAnother day in paradise!\n📊 TODAY\u0026rsquo;S NUMBERS Population (2022 census): 878,674 (finally released!)\nProjected population (2024): 956,044\nYears to release census: 4 (most countries: 6-12 months)\nOil wells lifespan: 3 years remaining\nParliament sessions: Still 0 (Week 11!)\nUnauthorized businesses shut down: 1 (Bel Air supermarket)\nBusinesses still operating illegally: 87% of all others\n📊 CENSUS DROPS AFTER 4-YEAR NAP The Bureau of Statistics finally released the 2022 Census results yesterday. You know, the census from 2022. It\u0026rsquo;s now 2026.\nThe Numbers:\nCensus day population (2022): 878,674 Projected population (end 2024): 956,044 Time it took to release: 4 years Average time for other countries: 6-12 months For perspective:\nMost countries release preliminary census results within 6-12 months. Final results within 2 years.\nGuyana? 4 years for preliminary results.\nBy the time we get final results, it\u0026rsquo;ll be time for the next census!\nWhat took so long? The Bureau of Statistics isn\u0026rsquo;t saying, but we have theories:\nExcel kept crashing Someone forgot the password Had to count people twice to make sure they were still there The abacus broke Needed to verify, then re-verify, then verify the re-verification Why it matters: For 4 years, we\u0026rsquo;ve been making budget allocations, planning infrastructure, and distributing resources based on\u0026hellip; vibes? The 2012 census? A ouija board?\nCensus data drives:\nBudget allocations (how much each region gets) Infrastructure planning (where to build roads, schools, hospitals) Resource distribution (who needs what) Electoral boundaries (voting districts) Policy decisions (everything else) So for 1,460 days, we\u0026rsquo;ve been flying blind. But hey, at least we were flying blind together!\nThe projection: Population grew from 878,674 (2022) to 956,044 (end 2024). That\u0026rsquo;s growth! That\u0026rsquo;s people staying instead of leaving! That\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; based on math from 4-year-old data, but we\u0026rsquo;ll take it!\nBy the time we get final results, it\u0026rsquo;ll be 2027 and we\u0026rsquo;ll need to start the 2030 census. The circle of (statistical) life!\n🛢️ OIL WELLS: STILL RACING TOWARD EMPTY Remember yesterday when we told you Liza One and Two will be empty in 3 years? Still true today! The countdown continues.\nThe situation:\nShould last: 20 years each Will actually last: 3 years total Current pumping rate: 140,000 barrels per day Barrels left: Getting smaller every minute Government strategy: Pump everything NOW, diversify\u0026hellip; eventually What this means:\nBy 2028, Liza One and Two will be tapped out. Empty. Done. Finito.\nMeanwhile, we\u0026rsquo;re still working on that whole \u0026ldquo;diversify the economy\u0026rdquo; thing. Any day now!\nThe wells are emptying faster than we can say \u0026ldquo;sustainable development strategy.\u0026rdquo;\nThe government\u0026rsquo;s defense? \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re getting the money NOW while oil prices are good!\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: We\u0026rsquo;re selling everything before the market crashes. It\u0026rsquo;s like liquidating your entire stock portfolio before a recession. Very bold strategy!\nThe irony: We\u0026rsquo;re racing to pump all our oil before prices crash, which will help crash prices faster, which means we should pump even faster, which will crash prices even more, which\u0026hellip;\nYou see the problem.\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;re building with oil money:\nRoads (good!) Bridges (excellent!) Gas-to-Energy plant (still \u0026ldquo;on track\u0026rdquo;!) Diversified economy (working on it!) Long-term strategy (TBD!) At least Gas-to-Energy is \u0026ldquo;firmly on track\u0026rdquo; for completion. By the time it\u0026rsquo;s done, we might not have any gas left to energy. But the plant will look great!\n🏛️ PARLIAMENT: WEEK 11 OF THE GREAT DISAPPEARING ACT Update: Parliament still hasn\u0026rsquo;t met. Not even once. Since November 3rd.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s now:\n11 weeks 77 days 2.75 months 1,848 hours of democracy on vacation 110,880 minutes of legislative silence The holdup: Speaker Manzoor Nadir refuses to call Parliament because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want Azruddin Mohamed (the extradition guy, the 47-appeals guy, THAT Mohamed) to become Opposition Leader.\nMeanwhile, waiting for Parliament:\nThe 2026 budget (you know, the one that funds everything) Venezuela crisis discussion (kind of important!) Oil depletion debate (3 years left, maybe talk about it?) US deportee talks transparency (still secret!) Constitutional reform (paused indefinitely) Opposition Leader appointment (the whole problem!) Literally everything else (on hold!) Status: Parliament more missing than the Opposition Leader they refuse to appoint\nWestern diplomats are concerned: US, UK, Canadian, and EU ambassadors all gently suggested that maybe democracy requires a functioning Parliament.\nThe US Ambassador: \u0026ldquo;We recognize the importance of a functioning opposition.\u0026rdquo;\nTranslation: \u0026ldquo;Guys, seriously, just hold a session already.\u0026rdquo;\nGovernment response: Strategic silence intensifies\nAt this rate:\nThe Liza oil wells will run dry before Parliament meets The next census will be due before Parliament meets We\u0026rsquo;ll have final 2022 census results before Parliament meets The real question: What happens first?\nParliament meets Mohamed gives up appealing Gas-to-Energy finishes Oil wells empty completely Smart money: All tied for last place.\n🏪 UNAUTHORIZED SUPERMARKET GETS INSTANT JUSTICE In a rare display of swift government action, the Central Housing and Planning Authority shut down Sheng Lian supermarket in Bel Air immediately for operating without planning permission.\nThe timeline:\nSupermarket opens without permission CH\u0026amp;PA notices CH\u0026amp;PA acts Cease and desist order issued Total time: Days, maybe hours The response: Lightning fast! Impressive! Swift! Like they meant business!\nWait a minute\u0026hellip;\nSo you\u0026rsquo;re telling us CH\u0026amp;PA can:\nSpot unauthorized operations instantly Issue cease orders immediately Act with lightning speed Enforce planning laws without hesitation But somehow:\nParliament can\u0026rsquo;t meet for 11 weeks 87% of businesses operate illegally (consumer laws) Census takes 4 years to release Gas-to-Energy has been \u0026ldquo;on track\u0026rdquo; since 2020 Opposition Leader still not appointed The selective efficiency is remarkable!\nTo be fair: Planning violations are serious. You can\u0026rsquo;t just open a supermarket wherever you want. There are rules. Infrastructure. Traffic. Community impact. Public safety.\nBut also: Maybe apply this same energy to literally everything else?\nLesson learned: If you want government to act quickly, violate planning permission. Want to avoid government action? Just file 47 appeals or be 87% non-compliant with consumer laws.\nThe supermarket owners probably wish they\u0026rsquo;d just filed 47 appeals like the Mohameds. That seems to work better. Or operated for 70 years like Golden Gloves (RIP, shut down for paperwork issues).\n🇺🇸 US DEPORTEE TALKS: GUYANA CAN\u0026rsquo;T SAY NO Kaieteur News dropped some uncomfortable truth bombs about the US deportee \u0026ldquo;talks.\u0026rdquo;\nThe situation: US wants to deport people from other countries to Guyana (not just Guyanese nationals). Government says we\u0026rsquo;re in \u0026ldquo;productive discussions.\u0026rdquo;\nThe reality: Guyana has about as much negotiating power as a rum shop has against a hurricane.\nKaieteur News put it perfectly:\n\u0026ldquo;Guyana is perfect. Not due to its vast spaces and great opportunities. Guyana is perfect for one reason only: it can\u0026rsquo;t say NO!\u0026rdquo;\nThe comparison: Same as the Exxon contract. One-sided. Handcuffs Guyana. Leaders reduced to messenger boys and smiley faces.\nWe smile, we sign, we say thank you, we take photos.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t we say no?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re a small country (less than 1 million people) We need US support against Venezuela (territorial dispute) We need US markets for our products (trade) We need US everything (security, aid, investment) We have no leverage (none, zero, zilch) What\u0026rsquo;s our bargaining position? Checks notes \u0026hellip;we have nice weather? Friendly people? Good curry?\nOpposition demands transparency. President Ali provides strategic silence. The \u0026ldquo;talks\u0026rdquo; may have already concluded. Guyana\u0026rsquo;s role? Sign here, smile for the camera, say \u0026ldquo;productive discussions.\u0026rdquo;\nThe pattern:\nExxon contract: Can\u0026rsquo;t say no US deportees: Can\u0026rsquo;t say no Venezuela handling: Need US support Everything else: Can\u0026rsquo;t say no Check the skies when it\u0026rsquo;s time to negotiate. That\u0026rsquo;s where our leverage flies off to. Somewhere over the Caribbean, probably near Barbados, living its best life.\n💰 CONSUMER AFFAIRS: THE ONE THING ACTUALLY WORKING In genuinely good news, the Competition and Consumer Affairs Commission is actually functioning!\nLast year\u0026rsquo;s numbers:\n506 complaints filed $509.6 million disputed 428 cases resolved (85% success rate!) $156 million recovered for consumers 1,331 business inspections conducted That\u0026rsquo;s real money back in real people\u0026rsquo;s pockets. That\u0026rsquo;s governance that actually works. That\u0026rsquo;s a system that functions!\nThe only problem: 87% of businesses are still non-compliant.\nBut at least now consumers can fight back. At least now there\u0026rsquo;s a system. At least now there\u0026rsquo;s hope. At least now there\u0026rsquo;s recourse!\nRome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day. The CCAC is building Rome one recovered dollar at a time.\nProgress is progress!\nWhy it\u0026rsquo;s working:\nPublic awareness campaigns (people know their rights!) Actual enforcement (consequences exist!) Follow-through (cases get resolved!) Money recovered (real results!) The 87% non-compliance rate explains so much about daily life in Guyana. Why does buying anything feel like combat negotiations? Because 87% of businesses are operating in the Wild West!\nBut now at least you can file a complaint. You can get your money back. You can fight back.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not perfect. But it\u0026rsquo;s progress. And we\u0026rsquo;ll take it!\n🎭 OTHER NEWS THAT MADE US DOUBLE-TAKE Criminal Backlog Drops: DPP announces cases down from 318 (2020) to 126 (2026). Actual measurable progress! Too bad Parliament can\u0026rsquo;t meet to pass new laws or reform the system.\nHouse Still Collapsed: La Penitence residents waiting on temporary housing assistance. Government promises help. Ministry responded within 24 hours with assessment. Now waiting on actual help.\nBanks DIH Still Making Beer: $13.7B malt plant operational and producing. At least our drinking needs are secure while everything else sorts itself out. Priorities!\nAirfares Drop: Trans Guyana Airways cut hinterland fares by 7%. Real help for real people. Actual good news that makes actual difference!\n📅 THE WEEK AHEAD Tuesday: Census data already outdated (you are here!)\nWednesday: Parliament still won\u0026rsquo;t meet (Week 11!)\nThursday: Oil wells get one day closer to empty\nFriday: Another business will probably open without permission\nWeekend: Brief respite (but the problems don\u0026rsquo;t take weekends off)\nNext Monday: Start this whole circus again!\n🤔 THE QUESTION WE\u0026rsquo;RE ALL ASKING If it takes:\n4 years to release a census 11 weeks to not hold Parliament 6 years for Gas-to-Energy to stay \u0026ldquo;on track\u0026rdquo; 47 appeals to not leave the country Days to shut down one supermarket But years to fix 87% business non-compliance How long does it take to actually fix something?\nAnswer: We\u0026rsquo;ll let you know when we find out. Still waiting on that data!\n📝 THE BOTTOM LINE The census finally dropped (4 years fashionably late, like showing up to a party after it\u0026rsquo;s over). Parliament continues its disappearing act (Week 11: The Legend Continues). Oil wells continue their race to empty (3 years and counting down). An unauthorized supermarket got shut down with impressive speed (efficiency exists!). And Guyana can\u0026rsquo;t say no to the US (shocking precisely nobody who\u0026rsquo;s been paying attention).\nThe pattern emerges:\nCensus: Take your time (4 years is fine!) Parliament: Just don\u0026rsquo;t show up (11 weeks and counting!) Oil: Pump everything NOW, think later (or never!) Enforcement: Selective and mysterious International negotiations: Can\u0026rsquo;t say no, won\u0026rsquo;t say no Consumer protection: Actually working! (Small miracles exist!) But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: at least the CCAC is functioning. At least consumers can fight back. At least one system works. At least some money got recovered.

You know what? They don\u0026rsquo;t understand how real governance works.\nLet me break it down for you.\n📊 CENSUS TOOK 4 YEARS? THAT\u0026rsquo;S CALLED BEING THOROUGH! All these critics crying \u0026ldquo;4 years is too long!\u0026rdquo; You know what I say? Quality over speed!\n878,674 people on census day 2022\n956,044 projected by end 2024\nYou think you just count people and done? NO!\nYou have to:\nVerify the data (multiple times!) Cross-check everything Make sure numbers accurate Quality control Double-check Triple-check These opposition people want us to rush and give wrong numbers? Then they\u0026rsquo;ll complain the numbers are wrong! You can\u0026rsquo;t win with these people!\nBetter to take 4 years and get it RIGHT than rush and get it WRONG.\nAnd you know what those numbers show? Population GROWING! From 878,000 to 956,000! People STAYING in Guyana instead of running away like they did under PNC!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the real story! But Stabroek News won\u0026rsquo;t tell you that!\n🏛️ PARLIAMENT \u0026ldquo;CRISIS\u0026rdquo; - SAME OLD OPPOSITION GAMES Now they crying about Parliament not meeting for 11 weeks. Let me ask you something:\nWhy they so desperate to install Azruddin Mohamed as Opposition Leader?\nThe same Mohamed facing extradition! The same Mohamed who filed 47 appeals! The same Mohamed the Americans want in jail!\nAnd these opposition people want to make THIS man Leader of the Opposition? With access to state secrets? With security briefings? With representing Guyana internationally?\nAre you CRAZY?\nThe Speaker doing his JOB:\nMaking sure everything proper and legal before installing someone facing extradition as Opposition Leader.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;undermining democracy\u0026rdquo; - that\u0026rsquo;s PROTECTING democracy!\nThe real question these newspapers should be asking: Why can\u0026rsquo;t the opposition find ONE person without criminal charges to lead them?\nJust one! Is that too much to ask?\nBut no, they want Mohamed. They NEED Mohamed. Why? What they hiding?\n🛢️ OIL PUMPING STRATEGY IS STILL SMART Yesterday I explained why pumping fast is the right strategy. Today I going to add more:\nYou know what happened in 2020? Oil prices went NEGATIVE. That\u0026rsquo;s right - NEGATIVE! Producers were PAYING people to take oil!\nYou know what\u0026rsquo;s happening now? Trump talking about flooding the market with Venezuelan oil. Prices going DOWN!\nYou know what\u0026rsquo;s coming in 10-15 years? Electric cars everywhere! Oil demand CRASHING!\nSo these critics want us to sit on our oil for 20 years waiting for what? For prices to crash? For demand to disappear? For the market to die?\nNO THANK YOU!\nSimple economics:\nOption A (Critics\u0026rsquo; way):\nPump slow → Market crashes → Oil worthless → We broke\nOption B (Government way):\nPump fast → Get money NOW → Build economy → Ready for future\nWhich makes sense? OPTION B!\nAnd look what we building with the oil money:\nNew roads everywhere Bridges connecting regions Schools and hospitals Gas-to-Energy (cheaper electricity coming!) Housing developments That\u0026rsquo;s investing in the future! That\u0026rsquo;s what smart governments do!\n🏪 ENFORCEMENT WHEN IT MATTERS Now they complaining that CH\u0026amp;PA shut down the Bel Air supermarket \u0026ldquo;too fast.\u0026rdquo;\nTOO FAST?\nSo when government acts slow, they complain. When government acts fast, they STILL complain!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t win with these opposition people!\nPlanning permission is serious! You can\u0026rsquo;t just open a business anywhere you want. There are rules! Infrastructure! Community impact!\nCH\u0026amp;PA did their JOB. They enforced the LAW. That\u0026rsquo;s what they supposed to do!\nBut where was this energy with the 87% of businesses violating consumer laws?\nFair question! And you know what? The CCAC is WORKING on it!\n506 complaints filed! $156 MILLION recovered! Systems being built!\nYou want them to fix 87% overnight? That\u0026rsquo;s not realistic!\nBut at least NOW there\u0026rsquo;s a system. At least NOW consumers can fight back. Under PNC, there was NOTHING!\nProgress takes time. But it\u0026rsquo;s happening!\n🇺🇸 US DEPORTEE TALKS - THIS IS CALLED DIPLOMACY Kaieteur News crying that \u0026ldquo;Guyana can\u0026rsquo;t say no to the US.\u0026rdquo;\nYou know what? They\u0026rsquo;re RIGHT! And that\u0026rsquo;s SMART!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re a small country! 900,000 people! You think we can tell the United States - the SUPERPOWER - no?\nLet me tell you something about international relations that these armchair critics don\u0026rsquo;t understand:\nYou work WITH powerful countries, not AGAINST them!\nWhat the US provides us:\nSecurity guarantee against Venezuela Market for our products Development aid International support Investment opportunities What we provide:\nCooperation Partnership Flexibility That\u0026rsquo;s called a RELATIONSHIP!\nSame with Exxon contract!\nCritics call it \u0026ldquo;one-sided.\u0026rdquo; I call it GETTING IN THE GAME!\nBefore Exxon:\nNo oil production No oil revenue No international investment Economy going nowhere Young people leaving After Exxon:\nAlmost 1 million barrels per day Billions in revenue World watching Guyana Economy transformed Diaspora coming BACK! You tell me which is better!\nThese critics want us to have said \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; to Exxon? Then we\u0026rsquo;d have ZERO oil revenue! We\u0026rsquo;d still be broke! We\u0026rsquo;d still be nobody!\nSometimes you have to work with what you got. And we got a chance with Exxon. We took it. Now we benefiting!\n💰 CONSUMER PROTECTION ACTUALLY WORKING Now this is something the government should get MORE credit for:\n$156 MILLION recovered for consumers!\nYou think PNC ever did that? You think APNU had a functioning CCAC? Please!\nThis government:\nBuilt the system Staffed it properly Gave it teeth Made it work And it\u0026rsquo;s WORKING!\nSure, 87% of businesses still non-compliant. But:\nAt least now there\u0026rsquo;s enforcement At least now consumers can complain At least now money gets recovered At least now there\u0026rsquo;s HOPE! Progress in action:\n2020: No system\n2025: 506 complaints, $156M recovered\n2026: System getting stronger\nThis is what governance looks like!\nYou want perfection overnight? That\u0026rsquo;s not realistic! But you want progress? WE GOT IT!\n📈 THE REAL NUMBERS THEY WON\u0026rsquo;T TELL YOU While opposition crying about census delays and Parliament and oil pumping, here\u0026rsquo;s what they NOT reporting:\nPopulation GROWING!\nFrom 878,674 to 956,044! People staying! People coming back! People having babies! That\u0026rsquo;s confidence in the country\u0026rsquo;s future!\nCriminal cases DROPPING!\nFrom 318 to 126! Justice system working! Courts clearing backlog! Under PNC, backlog was GROWING!\nInvestments POURING IN!\nBanks DIH: $13.7 billion malt plant!\nTrans Guyana Airways: Reducing fares!\nCompanies everywhere: Investing!\nInfrastructure EVERYWHERE!\nRoads, bridges, schools, hospitals, housing - you can SEE it with your own eyes!\nGas-to-Energy coming!\nCheaper electricity! Lower business costs! More competitive economy!\nCompare the trajectory:\nPNC era (2015-2020):\nBusinesses leaving Economy dying Crime rising Young people fleeing Nothing being built Corruption everywhere PPP/C era (2020-2026):\nInvestments coming Economy booming Systems working Diaspora returning Building everywhere Accountability increasing You tell me which you prefer!\n🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE These critics can complain all they want about:\nCensus taking 4 years (quality over speed!) Parliament not meeting (protecting democracy!) Oil pumping fast (smart economics!) US deportee talks (smart diplomacy!) But the FACTS speak for themselves:\nPopulation: Growing!\nEconomy: Growing!\nInvestment: Growing!\nInfrastructure: Growing!\nOpportunities: Growing!\nEverything GROWING under PPP/C government!\nYou want perfect governance? Show me ONE country with perfect governance! Just one!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t! Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist!\nBut you want PROGRESS? You want RESULTS? You want IMPROVEMENT?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what we got!\n💭 FINAL WORD (FROM BROOKLYN) I\u0026rsquo;m watching from Brooklyn. I\u0026rsquo;m reading ALL the newspapers. I\u0026rsquo;m watching ALL the news. I\u0026rsquo;m talking to family back home.\nAnd you know what they telling me?\nThings are BETTER!\nNot perfect. But BETTER!\nMore jobs available More opportunities More infrastructure More hope for the future More reasons to stay That\u0026rsquo;s what matters!\nThese opposition critics sitting in Georgetown complaining? They don\u0026rsquo;t represent the REAL Guyana. They don\u0026rsquo;t represent the people benefiting from new roads, new schools, new opportunities.\nThe proof:\nIf government so bad, why:\nPopulation growing not shrinking? Businesses investing not leaving? Diaspora returning not fleeing? Economy booming not dying? Because the government DELIVERING!\nCensus took 4 years? They made sure it was accurate!\nParliament not meeting? They making sure it\u0026rsquo;s done right!\nOil pumping fast? They getting money before market crashes!\nCan\u0026rsquo;t say no to US? They being smart about diplomacy!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s called GOVERNANCE!\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m proud to support it from Brooklyn!\nUncle Ramesh\nSpeaking Truth from the Diaspora 🇬🇾\n📢 TALK BACK! What you think? You agree the census delay was worth it for accuracy? You think the oil strategy makes sense? Let me know in the comments!\nBut bring FACTS, not just feelings!\nWe\u0026rsquo;re all Guyanese. We all want what\u0026rsquo;s best. We just see the path differently.\nBut the numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie - and the numbers say we\u0026rsquo;re moving FORWARD!\nUncle Ramesh is a Guyanese-American living in Brooklyn who keeps close tabs on homeland affairs. He reads all the newspapers, follows all the debates, and isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to call it like he sees it.

Azruddin Mohamed. The Mohamed family.\nBut beyond the headlines about extradition hearings, US sanctions, and courtroom drama, lies a more complex story about business, politics, and power in modern Guyana.\nThis is that story.\n🔑 Key Takeaways The Mohamed family built a multi-sector empire over decades before facing US sanctions in 2021 Their case involves complex legal questions about \u0026ldquo;dual criminality\u0026rdquo; in extradition law The cybercrime arrest of Stanley Basdeo added free speech and selective prosecution dimensions This saga reveals tensions between business, politics, and international relations in Guyana Ultimately about what kind of country Guyana wants to be in an interconnected world THE EMPIRE BUILDING The Mohamed business empire didn\u0026rsquo;t emerge overnight. Built over decades, it spans multiple sectors: retail and wholesale operations, real estate holdings across Georgetown, and import/export operations connecting Guyana to global markets.\nAt its peak, the family\u0026rsquo;s businesses employed hundreds of Guyanese and generated millions in revenue annually. \u0026ldquo;They built something real,\u0026rdquo; acknowledged one business competitor who spoke anonymously.\nTHE FIRST CRACKS The first public controversy emerged not in Guyana, but in the United States. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasury\u0026rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated several entities and individuals linked to what they described as \u0026ldquo;illicit gold trade networks in Guyana.\u0026rdquo;\nThe family vehemently denied the allegations, calling them based on \u0026ldquo;flawed intelligence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;political motivation.\u0026rdquo;\nTHE POLITICAL DIMENSION What transformed a sanctions case into Guyana\u0026rsquo;s biggest political controversy was the family\u0026rsquo;s alleged connections to government officials. Opposition politicians pointed to government contracts awarded to Mohamed-linked entities and photographs of family members at government events.\nThe government\u0026rsquo;s response was adamant: \u0026ldquo;The Mohameds are private businesspeople. Any contracts they received were through proper procurement processes.\u0026rdquo;\nTHE EXTRADITION BATTLE In 2025, the United States requested the extradition of Nazar and Azruddin Mohamed to face charges in New York. This is where the saga became truly complicated.\nGuyana\u0026rsquo;s extradition law requires \u0026ldquo;dual criminality\u0026rdquo;—the alleged offense must be a crime in both countries. The Mohameds\u0026rsquo; lawyers argued that the US sanctions violations weren\u0026rsquo;t crimes under Guyanese law.\nThe legal battle has been ongoing ever since, with hearings that have become media spectacles.\nTHE CYBERCRIME COMPLICATION Then came the cybercrime arrest. In January 2026, businessman Stanley Basdeo was arrested under Guyana\u0026rsquo;s Cybercrime Act for allegedly making defamatory statements about the Mohamed family online.\nThe arrest sparked immediate controversy about free speech, selective prosecution, and the boundaries of online commentary.\nTHE LESSONS What can we learn from this saga? About business, about law, about power, about media, and about justice. The Mohamed saga isn\u0026rsquo;t really about one family—it\u0026rsquo;s about how Guyana handles the intersection of business, politics, international pressure, and free speech in an interconnected era.\nThe Mohamed family will eventually have their day in court. But the broader questions the saga raises won\u0026rsquo;t be resolved in any courtroom. Those are questions only Guyanese society can answer, through the choices we make about the kind of country we want to be.\nShare This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like Caribbean Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting …\nFeb 14, 2026 Read more → Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Happy Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, Guyana.

Me sit down every morning with me tea, reading all four newspapers, and today me had to say – why everybody so negative? The government doing WORK! But all some people want to do is find fault. Well, not today. Today, Uncle Ramesh going set the record straight.\n📊 TODAY\u0026rsquo;S GOOD NEWS Census Population: 878,674 (finally counted!) 📈\nCrime Reduction: 25.5% drop (decade low!) 🛡️\nBanks DIH Investment: $13.7 BILLION 🏭\nAirfare Reduction: 7% across all hinterland routes ✈️\nInternational Interest: Ecuador exploring investments 🌍\n📋 The Census Finally Here – Better Late Than Perfect! The 2022 census results releasing today, and yes, is 2026. But ayuh ever try to count 878,674 people spread from Georgetown to the deep bush? Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh calling it a \u0026ldquo;mammoth exercise,\u0026rdquo; and the man speaking truth!\nCensus data is serious business! This going help the government plan properly for housing, schools, healthcare, infrastructure. And look: men now slightly outnumbering women in Guyana for the first time. That\u0026rsquo;s important data!\nThe Chronicle reporting this census critical for national planning. President Ali and the team can\u0026rsquo;t make good decisions without good data. Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day, and neither is a proper national census!\n🚀 Guyana in the Most Exciting Period – Minister Benn Speaking Facts! Minister Vanessa Benn say Guyana undergoing \u0026ldquo;one of the most exciting and transformative periods in its history,\u0026rdquo; and Uncle Ramesh say AMEN!\nLook what the government doing: aggressive housing drive, Single Window System making life easier, MSMEs getting up to $3 million in ZERO-COLLATERAL loans. You hear that? ZERO collateral! When Uncle Ramesh was young, you had to mortgage your grandmother for a business loan.\nMinister Benn also talking about the five-year development blueprint, improving healthcare, education, infrastructure. She laying out a PLAN while some people busy complaining. Me respect that leadership.\n🏭 Banks DIH $13.7 Billion Plant – Real Investment! A $13.7 BILLION plant! The Chronicle reporting this shows \u0026ldquo;growing investor confidence.\u0026rdquo; When private sector investing billions, they seeing a FUTURE. You think Banks DIH putting that kind of money if they ain\u0026rsquo;t confident?\nThe government creating the environment where business can thrive. Plus, is JOBS – construction, factory, distribution jobs. The opposition could learn about celebrating success instead of finding problems.\n🌍 Ecuadorian Firms Exploring Investment – The World Taking Notice! The Chronicle reporting companies from Ecuador exploring \u0026ldquo;strategic investment opportunities\u0026rdquo; in Guyana. Ecuador! That\u0026rsquo;s South America taking Guyana seriously as a regional economic hub.\nThis is the Ali administration foreign policy working. Good governance attracts investment. Ecuador seeing OPPORTUNITY, not problems. Uncle Ramesh remember when nobody wanted to invest except to sell old equipment. Now we got international firms lining up.\n✈️ Trans Guyana Airways Cutting Airfares 7% – Promises Kept! Trans Guyana Airways announcing 7% reduction in airfares to ALL hinterland airstrips, right after government rehabilitated them! Government fix the airstrips, airlines respond with lower prices, citizens benefit. That\u0026rsquo;s how good policy creates good outcomes! This is governance 101.\n📢 Opposition Want to Argue About US Talks – Missing the Point Yes, some people want transparency about US talks. And transparency good! But the mature way to handle sensitive diplomatic negotiations is to talk privately first, then inform the public when there\u0026rsquo;s something concrete.\nPresident Ali and Foreign Secretary Persaud having \u0026ldquo;productive discussions.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s called DIPLOMACY. The opposition calling it \u0026ldquo;secret talks,\u0026rdquo; but Uncle Ramesh call it PROPER PROTOCOL. Maybe wait and see the actual proposal before getting vex?\n🛡️ Crime Down 25.5% – The Numbers Don\u0026rsquo;t Lie! Here\u0026rsquo;s one even the negative people can\u0026rsquo;t argue with: serious crimes down 25.5% last year! From 1,235 cases to 920 cases. That\u0026rsquo;s the LOWEST in a DECADE!\nThe police force getting results under this government leadership. Better training, better equipment, better strategy. And yes, some people will say \u0026ldquo;but what about unreported crimes?\u0026rdquo; – but you can\u0026rsquo;t just ignore HARD DATA because it don\u0026rsquo;t fit your narrative.\nCrime down is GOOD NEWS. Period. The government and police working together to keep Guyana safe, and the statistics proving it working. Uncle Ramesh say well done to the men and women in uniform!\n🛢️ Oil Prices and Economic Management – Trust the Process Yes, oil prices might fall. But analyst Christopher Ram saying increased Stabroek Block production will compensate.\nThe government didn\u0026rsquo;t put all eggs in one basket. They diversifying (Banks DIH plant, Ecuadorian investments). They planning long term. They building infrastructure while oil money flowing. Is this administration first time with oil? Yes. Are they doing it perfectly? Nobody perfect. But are they making mostly good decisions? Absolutely!\n🌱 GuySuCo Getting Presidential Attention – Tough Love Is Still Love President Ali warned GuySuCo management about meeting production targets, and some people acting like that\u0026rsquo;s bad leadership. Uncle Ramesh say that\u0026rsquo;s EXACTLY what leadership look like! You think letting them just coast along and miss targets is better?\nThe sugar industry important to Guyana history, culture, and many livelihoods. If it not performing, the President SHOULD demand better. That\u0026rsquo;s not being mean – that\u0026rsquo;s being responsible with taxpayer money and workers\u0026rsquo; futures.\nThe Chronicle editorial today titled \u0026ldquo;The Sugar Industry\u0026rsquo;s Reckoning\u0026rdquo; talking about how this warning represents a crucial shift in strategy. Sometimes you need tough love to get results. Uncle Ramesh proud to see a President who not afraid to hold people accountable.\n💯 THE BOTTOM LINE While others seeing problems, Uncle Ramesh seeing census data for planning, record investment, international firms exploring opportunities, lower airfares, crime at decade lows, strategic economic management, and presidential accountability.\nIs everything perfect? No. But is Guyana in one of the most transformative periods in its history? ABSOLUTELY.\nThe government doing the work. The plans making sense. The results showing. Don\u0026rsquo;t just read complaints – read the PROGRESS too. Guyana on the move.\nNow excuse me, Uncle Ramesh going pour himself a Banks (from that beautiful new plant!) 🍺 and wait for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s good news.\nUncle Ramesh reads all four papers every morning. He just chooses to focus on progress. Agree? Disagree? That\u0026rsquo;s okay – healthy debate is democratic! 🗣️\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-12-uncle-ramesh-take/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"x1f1ecx1f1fe-uncle-rameshs-take-x1f1ecx1f1fe\"\u003e🇬🇾 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S TAKE 🇬🇾\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour Uncle from the Diaspora Who Actually Reads Past the Headlines\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreetings from Toronto, where it cold like ice but me heart warm with pride! ☕\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAyuh know Uncle Ramesh don\u0026rsquo;t like to complain.

No customary press conference. No fiery rebuttals. No multi-hour Q\u0026amp;A sessions that have become Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s trademark.\nThe silence is deafening.\nAnd in Guyanese politics, silence from Bharrat Jagdeo is more alarming than any statement he could make.\n🔑 Key Takeaways Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s 3-week silence breaks his 5-year pattern of weekly press conferences Three concurrent crises may explain the media blackout: Mohamed family saga, gas-to-energy controversy, and internal party tensions Creates a political vacuum that opposition leader Aubrey Norton is actively filling Could be either a strategic retreat or a sign of deeper internal issues When he returns, expect an explosive press conference addressing accumulated questions THE PATTERN BREAKS Since assuming the role of Vice President in August 2020, Jagdeo has held 147 press conferences—averaging one every 12 days. His Wednesday afternoon briefings became so predictable that journalists cleared their calendars, opposition politicians prepared responses before he even spoke, and ordinary Guyanese tuned in for what many called \u0026ldquo;the real news of the week.\u0026rdquo;\nBut on December 22, 2025, that pattern broke.\nThe first missed briefing coincided with the Christmas holidays—understandable, expected even. But then January 8 passed. Then January 15. Now, as we approach the end of January 2026, the silence continues.\nWHAT CHANGED? Multiple sources within the PPP/C, speaking on condition of anonymity, point to three concurrent crises that may explain the media blackout.\nThe Mohamed Family Extradition Saga: The ongoing legal battle involving the Mohamed family has created an uncomfortable spotlight. Every question about the case risks opening doors the administration would prefer remain closed.\nThe Gas-to-Energy Cost Controversy: Recent editorials questioning the gas-to-energy project\u0026rsquo;s economics compared to solar alternatives have hit a nerve. The project lacks the transparent cost breakdown typically demanded by Jagdeo himself.\nInternal Party Tensions: Less publicly visible but potentially more significant are reported tensions within the PPP/C regarding succession planning and the 2025 local government elections performance.\nTHE COST OF SILENCE Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s absence from the media landscape has created a vacuum. Opposition leader Aubrey Norton has held three press conferences in the past two weeks. Social media speculation has filled the void, with theories ranging from illness to political maneuvering to preparation for early elections.\nA STRATEGIC RETREAT? Some analysts suggest the silence might be calculated rather than circumstantial. Without Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s controversial statements drawing fire, government accomplishments received more sustained coverage.\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes the best communication strategy is to not communicate,\u0026rdquo; one communications advisor suggested. \u0026ldquo;Let your opponents punch at shadows.\u0026rdquo;\nCONCLUSION Three weeks of silence from a man known for never shutting up. Is it strategy? Crisis management? Health concerns? Internal party maneuvering?\nThe answer likely involves elements of all these factors. What\u0026rsquo;s certain is this: When Jagdeo does return to the podium—and he will—he\u0026rsquo;ll have months of questions waiting.\nUntil then, we wait. And in that waiting, we learn something important about power in Guyana: Sometimes silence speaks louder than the most carefully crafted statement.\nShare This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like Caribbean Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting …\nFeb 14, 2026 Read more → Daily Brief – February 14, 2026 Happy Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, Guyana.

Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.\nFor Context: That\u0026rsquo;s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No \u0026ldquo;oops, my bad.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Happened:\nContractor lifting materials Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines GPL (Guyana Power \u0026amp; Light) technicians notice Emergency shutdown before catastrophe The Scary Part: This wasn\u0026rsquo;t discovered by the contractor. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.\nTranslation: Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren\u0026rsquo;t followed. And we only know about it because GPL\u0026rsquo;s people were alert.\nNSTRUCTION WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan â†’ Survey site â†’ Identify hazards â†’ Implement safety â†’ Execute\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) â†’ Start work â†’ Almost cause disaster â†’ Act surprised â†’ Blame someone else\nThe Questions Nobody\u0026rsquo;s Asking:\nWho approved this project without a proper safety plan? Why were the power lines not clearly marked? What happens to the contractor? The Answers: Probably nothing, probably nobody, and definitely \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re looking into it.\u0026rdquo;\nSTATS: MURDER UP, ROAD DEATHS UP, VIBES DOWN RIME STATISTICS:\nMurders: UP 11% (134 total)\nRoad Deaths: UP 6% (140 total)\nGovernment Response: \"Crime is down!\"\nPublic: \"Please be serious.\" The police released 2025 crime statistics, and the numbers tell a story the government doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear.\nMurders: 134 (up from 121 in 2024) Road Deaths: 140 (up from 132 in 2024)\nGovernment\u0026rsquo;s Spin: \u0026ldquo;Overall crime is down! Look at the big picture!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Big Picture: More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That\u0026rsquo;s the picture.\nThe Breakdown:\nMurders: 11% increase Road deaths: 6% increase Combined: 274 lives lost What Actually Decreased: Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?\nSING CRIME:\nWhat Works: Community policing, better training, accountability, improved response times\nWhat We Got: \"Crime is down!\" (when it's actually up in the categories that matter most)\nM GUYANA: STILL STRUGGLING The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.\nIncident #1: French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.\nIncident #2: British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana \u0026ldquo;Third World.\u0026rdquo; Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.\nThe Pattern: When tourists show reality, we attack the tourists instead of fixing the reality.\n40,000 HOUSES PROMISE G MATH CHECK:\nPromise: 40,000 houses by 2028\nTime Remaining: ~3 years\nRequired Pace: 37 houses PER DAY\nCurrent Reality: Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.\nVice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government\u0026rsquo;s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Do The Math:\n40,000 houses Ã· 3 years = 13,333 houses/year 13,333 houses Ã· 365 days = 36.5 houses PER DAY For Perspective: That\u0026rsquo;s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.\nCurrent Status: They\u0026rsquo;ve allocated land. Land allocation â‰ built houses.\nECTRICITY PROMISE (REMEMBER THAT?) Remember when they promised \u0026ldquo;no more blackouts\u0026rdquo; by end of 2024? It\u0026rsquo;s 2026. Still waiting.\nThe Pattern:\nMake bold promise Miss deadline Announce new timeline Repeat POSITION: STILL MISSING Where is the opposition? Seriously, where are they? The Mohamed case has Parliament frozen. No sessions, no debates, no oversight.\nDemocracy Requires: Active opposition holding government accountable\nWhat We Have: Silence\nGOOD NEWS: AISHALTON AIRSTRIP Finally, some genuinely good news!

The Guyana Brief is Guyana\u0026rsquo;s premier satirical news commentary platform. Every day, we read all four of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s major newspapers — Guyana Chronicle, Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, and Guyana Times — so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nWe distill the news into a 5-6 minute read that\u0026rsquo;s informative, entertaining, and occasionally absurd. Because sometimes, the only way to make sense of the news is to laugh at it.\nOur Format: The Dueling Blogs We present Guyana\u0026rsquo;s news through two distinct voices:\nThe Daily Brief (Critical View) Our flagship feature covers 8-12 stories from all four newspapers with sharp, satirical commentary. We ask the questions everyone\u0026rsquo;s thinking but nobody\u0026rsquo;s saying out loud.\nUncle Ramesh (Diaspora View) Our fictional commentator from Queens, New York offers the pro-government diaspora perspective. Uncle Ramesh reads the same newspapers and sees\u0026hellip; something entirely different. Together, the Daily Brief and Uncle Ramesh give you both sides of every story.\nWeekly Features Day Features Sunday Speedeet and Wilar, De Boys Seh Wednesday Progress Report, The Rumor Mill Friday DJ Roadblock, Patriots Portfolio Saturday Bam-Bam Sally, Back-A-Truck, Bounty Board Meet Our Characters Speedeet and Wilar — Two 12-year-old best friends from Pike Street, Kitty, navigating childhood adventures in Guyana De Boys Seh — Kid commentary on the news (from Speedeet and Wilar\u0026rsquo;s perspective) DJ Roadblock — Traffic and infrastructure updates with attitude Bam-Bam Sally — Fictional gossip column (all names and scenarios are entirely made up) Progress Report — Tracking government projects and promises Patriots Portfolio — Following the business moves of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s elite Back-A-Truck — Weekend deals and market finds Bounty Board — Community notices and events The Caribbean Daily Brief We\u0026rsquo;re expanding! The Caribbean Daily Brief covers regional news from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and across the Caribbean with the same satirical voice. Because the drama doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at Guyana\u0026rsquo;s borders.\nOur Mission In a media landscape often divided along political lines, The Guyana Brief aims to:\nInform — Summarize the day\u0026rsquo;s news from multiple sources Entertain — Make the news accessible and engaging Question — Hold all sides accountable through satire Balance — Present multiple perspectives (even fictional ones) We believe Guyanese deserve news coverage that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take itself too seriously, while still taking the issues seriously.\nImportant Disclaimers The Guyana Brief is satirical commentary.\nAll content is based on news reported in Guyana\u0026rsquo;s four major newspapers Our satire targets policies, decisions, and situations — never individuals personally Uncle Ramesh is a fictional character and does not represent any real person Bam-Bam Sally\u0026rsquo;s gossip column uses entirely fictional names and scenarios Speedeet and Wilar are fictional characters; their stories are meant to entertain We are committed to operating within the bounds of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s Cybercrime Act 2018, particularly Section 19.

Budget 2026 has officially dropped and we\u0026rsquo;ve got A LOT to unpack.\nSenior Minister in the Office of the President with Responsibility for Finance, Dr. Ashni Singh, just presented a $1.588 TRILLION dollar budget to the National Assembly. That\u0026rsquo;s a 15% increase from last year\u0026rsquo;s $1.38 trillion.\nLet me break down what this means for you.\n[PAUSE]\nHOUSING — The Big Spend\n$159.1 BILLION is going to housing development. The government plans to distribute 15,000 new house lots and build 8,000 homes this year.\nDr. Singh said — and I quote — \u0026ldquo;Our investments in housing are not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride.\u0026rdquo;\nThe focus is on reducing the backlog of applications outside Region Four. So if you\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for a lot in Berbice, Essequibo, or the hinterland regions — things are supposed to speed up.\n[PAUSE]\nSPECIAL NEEDS — A Historic Moment\nNow THIS is genuinely exciting news.\n$316.5 million is allocated for special needs education and disability services. And the highlight? Guyana is getting its FIRST school specifically designed for autistic students. It will be built at the Cyril Potter College of Education campus.\nFor families who have been struggling to find proper educational support for special needs children — this is a game changer. Whatever your politics, this is progress.\n[PAUSE]\nTOURISM — Breaking Records\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a number that might surprise you: Guyana welcomed 453,489 visitors in 2025. That\u0026rsquo;s the HIGHEST number EVER recorded.\nThe government is doubling down with:\nA new Hospitality and Tourism Institute training 700+ people 56 communities added to tourism circuits Air Transat launching twice-weekly flights to Toronto — that\u0026rsquo;s 796 extra seats per week A push for diaspora tourism — weddings, reunions, conferences Dr. Singh called it a \u0026ldquo;sustainable, diversified, people-centred tourism economy.\u0026rdquo; The hotels are being built. Now we just need the airport to keep up.\n[PAUSE]\nAGRICULTURE — The Rural Revolution\n$745 million is going to agro-processing this year.\nNew facilities are coming to Parika and Lethem. The Regional Food Hub at Yarrowkabra is expected to complete THIS YEAR. And 373 agro-processors have already been trained in packaging, labeling, and product presentation.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the big news for farmers: Corporate tax has been REMOVED for agriculture and agro-processing businesses.\nPlus, 25 Guyana Shop corners have been launched across the country — and one in Barbados — to promote locally-produced goods.\n[PAUSE]\nBUSINESS REACTION\nThe Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry is happy. They praised the removal of corporate tax on agriculture, the US$100 million zero-interest development bank, and the VAT removal on locally made furniture and jewelry.\nThey called it \u0026ldquo;transformational\u0026rdquo; for small and medium businesses.\n[PAUSE]\nOPPOSITION RESPONSE\nNow, the opposition wasn\u0026rsquo;t consulted on this budget. APNU leader Aubrey Norton said two weeks ago — and I quote — \u0026ldquo;The government doesn\u0026rsquo;t engage, because in their opinion, they will look as though they are taking ideas from us.\u0026rdquo;\nMP Sharma Solomon pointed to independent statistics showing a 58% poverty rate.\nNorton predicted \u0026ldquo;the same old budget.\u0026rdquo;\nWell\u0026hellip; he got a bigger budget. Whether it addresses poverty comprehensively — that\u0026rsquo;s the debate that will continue.\n[PAUSE]\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nBudget 2026 is BIG. $1.588 trillion in spending, 14.3% economic growth in 2025, record tourism, historic special needs investment, and major agricultural support.\nWhether it reaches the people who need it most — that\u0026rsquo;s the question every Guyanese should be asking.\nFor full analysis, visit guyanadailybrief dot com.\nI\u0026rsquo;m your host for The Daily Brief.

From Bridgetown to Kingston, Port of Spain to Georgetown — here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s making waves across the region today!\n🇺🇸 US-CARIBBEAN RELATIONS: THE TENSION CONTINUES The Headlines:\nIMF approves $415M emergency assistance for Jamaica Caribbean nations facing stricter US visa scrutiny in 2026 Barbados FM concerned about US military strikes bypassing \u0026ldquo;due process\u0026rdquo; US reaffirms partnership with Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago The Brief: The US and Caribbean relationship looking more complicated than a Port of Spain traffic roundabout!\nJamaica just secured $415 million from the IMF. You know things serious when the IMF is your financial advisor. But hey, at least somebody answering Jamaica\u0026rsquo;s calls!\nMeanwhile, Caribbean nationals facing tighter US visa scrutiny. Birth tourism crackdown, they calling it. So now when pregnant Caribbean women want to visit Disney World, they gon get the third degree at the embassy. \u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rsquo;am, what\u0026rsquo;s your due date? And why exactly do you want to see Mickey Mouse in your third trimester?\u0026rdquo;\nBarbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds watching those US military strikes in the Caribbean Sea and raising eyebrows. \u0026ldquo;Due process,\u0026rdquo; he say. The Americans basically patrolling Caribbean waters like it\u0026rsquo;s their swimming pool, and our ministers can only send strongly worded statements.\nBut Trinidad somehow getting love letters from Trump administration! Kamla Persad-Bissessar and Trump apparently best friends now. Strange bedfellows, but politics make for strange everything these days.\n🇻🇪 VENEZUELA: NEW MANAGEMENT, SAME DRAMA The Headlines:\nVenezuela interim president moves to overhaul oil law US-Venezuela tensions continue The Brief: Venezuela got new management and they already rewriting the oil laws.\nEvery Caribbean nation watching this like hawks. Venezuela change their oil deals, Guyana gon want to renegotiate. Trinidad gon want better gas terms. And the oil companies? They just shuffling lawyers from one country to the next like a Caribbean legal tour.\nThe US invasion (sorry, \u0026ldquo;military operation\u0026rdquo;) aftermath still playing out. Bombs falling in Caracas, the Caribbean calling for \u0026ldquo;dialogue,\u0026rdquo; and everybody pretending this is normal international relations.\nBut you know how Caribbean people stay — we gon watch the drama, make commentary, and still fly through Venezuelan airspace because the tickets cheap.\n🇯🇲 JAMAICA: WINNING ELECTIONS, NEEDING MONEY The Headlines:\nAndrew Holness wins third consecutive term Jamaica secures $415M IMF emergency assistance Gas prices up in Jamaica The Brief: Andrew Holness just became the first Jamaica Labour Party leader to win THREE terms in a row! Historic!\nOf course, the margin smaller than the last election, but a win is a win. Just like a Jamaican patty with less filling — still a patty!\nBut winning don\u0026rsquo;t pay the bills. That $415 million IMF package shows Jamaica still struggling post-Hurricane Melissa. Climate change hitting the Caribbean different, and our economies built on beaches that keep washing away.\nGas prices up too. Everything up except wages. Classic Caribbean economy vibes.\n🇧🇧 BARBADOS: POLITICS AND RUNNING The Headlines:\nTyra Trotman wins BLP nomination for St Michael Central UK marathon runner launches \u0026ldquo;Project Run 246\u0026rdquo; charity run Barbados Sailing Week 2026 announced The Brief: Barbados Labour Party nomination battles heating up! Lawyer Tyra Trotman defeated Dr Lynette Holder for St Michael Central. Legal eagle beats the doctor — sounds like the start of a bad lawyer joke.\nMeanwhile, some British man running around the entire island for charity. \u0026ldquo;Project Run 246\u0026rdquo; — the area code turned fitness challenge. Bajans watching from their rum shop like \u0026ldquo;He running in THIS heat? For free?!\u0026rdquo;\nSailing Week 2026 announced too. Rich people sailing, regular people watching, rum flowing regardless. The Caribbean economy in action!\n🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: CRICKET AND POLITICS The Headlines:\nTrinbago Knight Riders win fifth CPL title T\u0026amp;T-US relations reaffirmed amid Venezuela tensions CCJ-CARICOM mess continues The Brief: Trinbago Knight Riders bringing home trophy number FIVE! The CPL trophy more at home in Trinidad than anywhere else. At this point, just rename it the Trinidad Premier League and done!\nBut off the field, Trinidad playing a delicate game. US wants them close because of Venezuela proximity. Trinidad wants US money but doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be seen as a US puppet. Classic Caribbean diplomacy: smile at everybody, commit to nobody, and keep the oil flowing.\nThe CCJ-CARICOM situation still a mess. Jamaica and Bahamas creating confusion, and the rest of the region watching like it\u0026rsquo;s a bad soap opera. We created CARICOM for regional unity and can\u0026rsquo;t even agree on a court. Beautiful.\n🇬🇾 GUYANA: OIL MONEY AND OPPOSITION DRAMA The Headlines:\nBudget 2026 coming Monday Opposition Leader vote finally happening INTERPOL busts gold smuggling ring The Brief: Guyana, Guyana, Guyana. The region\u0026rsquo;s hottest economy and messiest politics!\nBudget 2026 dropping Monday. Every year Guyana\u0026rsquo;s budget bigger than the year before. At this rate, by 2030, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s budget gon be bigger than some Caribbean countries\u0026rsquo; GDP!\nThe Opposition Leader drama would make good Netflix content. A US-indicted businessman about to become Leader of the Opposition while the former opposition party can\u0026rsquo;t decide whether to vote. Exxon watching this and laughing all the way to the bank.\nINTERPOL found a gold smuggling ring. In Guyana. Where gold is everywhere. Truly shocking that people would try to smuggle the thing that literally makes people rich. Next they gon discover water smuggling in Trinidad!\n🏏 CRICKET UPDATE West Indies vs Afghanistan T20 series coming up in Dubai CWI Women\u0026rsquo;s Blaze T20 Championships ongoing Guyana women defeated Jamaica in thriller Cricket is the one thing uniting the Caribbean right now. Everything else is politics, but cricket? That\u0026rsquo;s religion.\n🌊 REGIONAL ROUNDUP Cuba: Still struggling under US sanctions. Power cuts, fuel shortages, and 2026 looking harder than 2025.\nGrenada: Under increased US visa scrutiny but pushing solar energy with Carib Brewery. At least the beer will be green!\nSt. Vincent: Sailing Week countdown begun. Tourism dollars incoming!\nDominican Republic: E-passport rollout happening. Technology reaching the Caribbean!\nUSVI: Refinery cleanup continuing. Environmental sins of the past still paying dividends\u0026hellip; of the bad kind.\n💭 CARIBBEAN THOUGHT OF THE DAY The US putting military ships in our waters, tightening our visas, and demanding \u0026ldquo;partnerships.\u0026rdquo;\nBut when we need climate funding? \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you.\u0026rdquo; When we need debt relief? \u0026ldquo;Have you considered the IMF?\u0026rdquo; When our people need to migrate? \u0026ldquo;Not like that!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Caribbean stuck between superpowers, and we just trying to keep the lights on and the tourists coming.\nBut we Caribbean. We survive hurricanes, colonialism, and each other. We gon survive this too.\nOne Caribbean! 🌴\nThe Caribbean Daily Brief: Because regional news matters, and somebody has to read all these different newspapers!\nSources: Caribbean Today, Caribbean News Global, Nation News (Barbados), Jamaica Observer, Trinidad Express, Kaieteur News, Stabroek News, Guyana Times, Guyana Chronicle\n© 2026 The Guyana Brief.
