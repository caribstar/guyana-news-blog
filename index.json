But every morning, she looks at a photo on her desk: her grandmother\u0026rsquo;s wooden house in Berbice, where she grew up without electricity.\nThe Journey \u0026ldquo;People ask me how I got from there to here,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Persaud says, gesturing around her state-of-the-art operating suite. \u0026ldquo;I tell them: I got here because I started there.\u0026rdquo;\nBorn in New Amsterdam in 1985, Sharmila was the first in her family to attend university. Her father drove a taxi. Her mother sold vegetables at the market. They had one dream: their daughter would become a doctor.\nAgainst the Odds The path wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy:\nStudied by kerosene lamp when power was out (which was often) Walked 3 miles to school in Berbice rain Helped her mother at the market before classes Won a scholarship to Queen\u0026rsquo;s College in Georgetown Graduated top of her class at University of Guyana medical school A scholarship to Johns Hopkins came next. Then residency. Then fellowship. Now, at 40, she\u0026rsquo;s one of the leading neurosurgeons in North America.\nThe Guyana Connection But success hasn\u0026rsquo;t severed her rootsâ€”it\u0026rsquo;s strengthened them.\nDr. Persaud:\nReturns to Guyana quarterly for medical missions Has trained 15 Guyanese doctors in neurosurgery techniques Established a scholarship fund for Berbice students Donated equipment to Georgetown Public Hospital Mentors young Guyanese doctors remotely \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m successful because Guyana made me who I am,\u0026rdquo; she explains. \u0026ldquo;The work ethic, the resilience, the determinationâ€”that\u0026rsquo;s all Guyana.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Berbice Spirit She tells the story of performing a 14-hour surgery on a young patient last year. Exhausted, she almost asked her team to take over.\n\u0026ldquo;Then I remembered my mother standing in the market for 16 hours a day, never complaining. I thought: if she could do that selling vegetables, I can do this saving a life.\u0026rdquo;\nThe surgery succeeded.\nAdvice for Young Guyanese Dr. Persaud is often asked to speak at schools in Guyana. Her message is consistent:\n\u0026ldquo;Your circumstances don\u0026rsquo;t define your destination. I studied by lamplight. You have electricity and internet. You have no excuseâ€”and unlimited potential.\u0026rdquo;\nShe pauses. \u0026ldquo;But also: never forget where you came from. Success means nothing if you don\u0026rsquo;t bring others along.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Return Plan Dr. Persaud has a five-year plan: establish Guyana\u0026rsquo;s first dedicated neurosurgery center in Georgetown.\n\u0026ldquo;We train excellent doctors in Guyana,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;But then we lose them because we don\u0026rsquo;t have the facilities to use their skills. That has to change.\u0026rdquo;\nShe\u0026rsquo;s already raised $2 million toward the project. The Guyanese diaspora is contributing. So are international partners impressed by Guyana\u0026rsquo;s potential.\n\u0026ldquo;My grandmother\u0026rsquo;s generation left Guyana for opportunity,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Persaud reflects. \u0026ldquo;My generation left Guyana for education.

Georgetown, once known for its colonial charm mixed with urban challenges, is undergoing a transformation that would have seemed impossible just five years ago.\nThe Numbers Tell the Story Since 2020, Georgetown has seen:\n40+ new businesses opening on Main Street alone $500 million invested in waterfront development 300% increase in tourism infrastructure 12 new hotels under construction or recently opened Beyond the Statistics But the real story isn\u0026rsquo;t in the numbers—it\u0026rsquo;s in the people.\nRajiv Persaud, who returned from Toronto last year to open a tech startup, puts it simply: \u0026ldquo;I left because I didn\u0026rsquo;t see opportunity. I came back because now I see nothing but opportunity.\u0026rdquo;\nHis company, GuyanaTech Solutions, now employs 45 Guyanese developers, many of whom were considering emigration before finding high-paying tech jobs at home.\nThe Waterfront Renaissance The Demerara River waterfront, once avoided after dark, now bustles with evening activity. New restaurants serve everything from traditional pepperpot to international fusion cuisine. Families stroll along newly lit promenades. Street vendors sell coconut water and plantain chips to office workers on lunch breaks.\n\u0026ldquo;My grandmother remembers when this was the heart of Georgetown,\u0026rdquo; says Michelle Chen, owner of River\u0026rsquo;s Edge Café. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not building something new—we\u0026rsquo;re reclaiming something we lost.\u0026rdquo;\nChallenges Remain Not everything is perfect. Traffic congestion has worsened with prosperity. Housing prices are rising faster than wages for some. The infrastructure upgrades can\u0026rsquo;t keep pace with demand.\nBut these are, as Mayor Patricia Williams notes, \u0026ldquo;the problems of a city that\u0026rsquo;s growing, not dying.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Diaspora Returns Perhaps most telling: the flow is reversing. More Guyanese are returning home than leaving. The \u0026ldquo;brain drain\u0026rdquo; that plagued the nation for decades is becoming a \u0026ldquo;brain gain.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the University of Guyana, Professor David Singh sees it in his classrooms: \u0026ldquo;Students used to ask me how to get into foreign universities. Now they ask me how to build businesses here.\u0026rdquo;\nLooking Forward The transformation of Georgetown is just beginning. Plans are underway for:\nA modern public transportation system Expansion of the Cheddi Jagan International Airport A new convention center to attract regional conferences Smart city initiatives including free public WiFi Green spaces and urban parks What It Means Georgetown\u0026rsquo;s transformation is more than physical infrastructure. It represents a psychological shift—from a nation that exported its talent to one that nurtures and retains it.\nWalking through Bourda Market on a Saturday morning, you hear it in conversations. Pride. Hope. Excitement about tomorrow.\nOne vendor, selling mangoes and plantains, summed it up: \u0026ldquo;My children don\u0026rsquo;t have to leave anymore. That\u0026rsquo;s everything.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Guyanese Horizon This monthly feature will chronicle Guyana\u0026rsquo;s journey—the successes, the challenges, the people building tomorrow.

I laughed.) 😂\nDe REAL Numbers (Not De Comedy Version) What Comedy Crew Said:\n70 potholes reported 2 fixed Success rate: 2.8% Uncle Ramesh = Comedy goldmine What ACTUALLY Happened (After 3 Weeks):\n127 potholes reported (I wasn\u0026rsquo;t done!) 31 ACTUALLY FIXED = 24.4% ✅ 18 scheduled next phase = 14.2% 📅 42 long-term maintenance = 33.1% 🔧 36 still reviewing = 28.3% 🔍 Math check: 24.4% success rate in 3 weeks!\nIs it perfect? NO. Is it better than de ZERO potholes that was getting fix before? ABSOLUTELY YES!\nLet Me Explain De Process (Because Y\u0026rsquo;all Don\u0026rsquo;t Understand) Phase 1: Verification (Days 1-3)\nWhen you report pothole, government not just accepting blindly! Dey checking:\n❓ Is this duplicate? (Remember, LBI pothole got 15 reports!) ❓ Location accurate? ❓ Is it REALLY a pothole or just normal wear? ❓ How severe?\nDe yellow circles? That\u0026rsquo;s de verification mark saying: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we CONFIRM this hole exist!\u0026rdquo;\nSpeedeet to me yesterday: \u0026ldquo;But dey could just FIX it instead of PAINT it!\u0026rdquo;\nMe: \u0026ldquo;Bai, de painting crew and de fixing crew is DIFFERENT people! You want de PAINTER to fill pothole with PAINT?!\u0026rdquo; 😂\nPhase 2: Priority Ranking (Days 4-7)\nMinistry ranking by:\nTraffic volume (busy roads first) Safety risk (near schools/hospitals = priority) Repair efficiency (fix 10 holes in one area vs. 1 hole far away) Available crews and materials This is why some holes get fix quick and others waiting!\nWilar ask me: \u0026ldquo;So de government playing favorites with potholes?\u0026rdquo;\nMe: \u0026ldquo;No, dey playing LOGISTICS! You want dem fix one hole in Berbice today and one hole in Essequibo tomorrow? De FUEL cost alone!\u0026rdquo;\nPhase 3: Actual Repair (Ongoing)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what people DON\u0026rsquo;T understand:\nGovernment CAN\u0026rsquo;T fix 3,847 potholes overnight because:\nLimited asphalt (have to ORDER it!) Limited crews (only so many workers!) Limited budget (oil money not unlimited!) Weather (can\u0026rsquo;t patch in rain!) Traffic management (can\u0026rsquo;t close ALL roads!) Is project management, not magic! 🪄\nDe SUCCESS Story Nobody Talking About! Before De App (January 1-7):\nPotholes fixed: Maybe 3 (random crew assignments) Complaints logged: 89 phone calls (most lost in system) Response time: Unknown (no tracking) Accountability: ZERO After De App (January 8-29):\nReports received: 3,847 nationwide 📱 Verified: 3,421 (88.9%) ✅ ACTUALLY FIXED: 847 (24.8%) 🎉 Average response time: 11.3 days ⏱️ Citizen satisfaction: 67% 👍 That\u0026rsquo;s 847 potholes fixed in 3 weeks versus maybe 10-15 before!\nBut nobody talking about THAT! Y\u0026rsquo;all too busy making yellow circle jokes! 😂\nWhat De Comedy Crew CONVENIENTLY Left Out 1. Transparency Revolution\nBEFORE: You call Ministry → \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll look into it\u0026rdquo; → never hear back → pothole becomes swimming pool\nNOW: You can track EVERYTHING!

Lazy!\u0026rdquo;\nDe ACTUAL purpose of yellow circles:\n1️⃣ Verification mark - Field team confirming location 2️⃣ Night visibility - Drivers can SEE de hole in dark! (I personally witness 2 accidents PREVENTED!) 3️⃣ Tracking system - Repair crews know which holes are logged\nSo yes, paint is not REPAIR. But paint is not USELESS either!\nWilar to me: \u0026ldquo;But Uncle Ramesh, yellow circle don\u0026rsquo;t fix my suspension!\u0026rdquo;\nMe: \u0026ldquo;True!

For a pro-government perspective, see Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s take.\n🌎 Guyanese Leads Regional Agriculture Body Big News: Muhammad Ibrahim officially takes over as Director-General of the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) today, January 15. The Guyanese agronomist now heads this crucial regional agricultural cooperation body, marking another international leadership role for Guyana.\nWhy It Matters: As Guyana expands its agricultural sector beyond oil, having a Guyanese national leading regional agricultural policy could benefit the country\u0026rsquo;s diversification efforts.\n📊 Census Data Sparks Housing Debate The Numbers Don\u0026rsquo;t Add Up: Critics are using the newly released 2022 Census data to challenge the government\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;housing crisis\u0026rdquo; narrative. Between 2012 and 2022:\nPopulation grew by 17.6% Households expanded by 32.9% Building stock surged by 42% The Argument: The country added 92,233 new structures while the population grew by 131,719 people. Those buildings could accommodate nearly 300,000 people—more than twice the actual population increase.\nInfrastructure Reality Check:\nNational electricity demand hit 221 MW, straining GPL Wales Gas-to-Energy project delayed until late 2026 Thousands of allocated house lots lack power, water, or road access The Conclusion: Critics say this reveals \u0026ldquo;overbuilding and a planning crisis,\u0026rdquo; not a housing shortage. Government spending continues on roads and preparatory works that deliver minimal functional improvement.\n⚖️ Law Year Opens with Harsh Words AG Goes Off: Attorney General Anil Nandlall used the opening of Law Year 2026 to blast magistrates\u0026rsquo; courts for failing to apply modern legislation. He didn\u0026rsquo;t hold back on criticizing the failure to implement key laws already on the books.\nActing Chancellor Responds: Roxane George called for honoring constitutional provisions addressing the financial autonomy of the judiciary. Translation: Give us our money and independence.\nThe Pattern: This continues a trend of public finger-pointing between the executive and judiciary rather than quiet reform.\n🔒 Cybercrime Law Under Fire Selective Enforcement Alleged: The arrest of Stanley Basdeo under the Cybercrime Act has sparked accusations of politically motivated prosecution. Critics note:\nBasdeo criticized government over gun license denial Pro-government social media figures using \u0026ldquo;vulgarity, racial invective, and wild accusations\u0026rdquo; face no charges The law appears to target government critics while ignoring supporters The Warning: \u0026ldquo;In every autocratic society, loyalty is temporary and usefulness is transactional. Those applauding state overreach today may soon find themselves the next target.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake: Critics say Guyana is witnessing \u0026ldquo;the erosion of free speech through fear, and the normalization of repression through law.\u0026rdquo;\n🤐 President Silent on Migrant Deal No Comment: President Ali refused to provide details on the arrangement with the US for Guyana to accept third-country nationals, telling reporters to refer to a Foreign Secretary statement that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually exist.\nWhat We Know: Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud previously said the governments are \u0026ldquo;nearing an agreement\u0026rdquo; for Guyana to receive refugees or non-felons, with Georgetown having the right to refuse.\nThe Problem: Major policy decisions affecting the country\u0026rsquo;s demographics and resources being made with minimal public disclosure or consultation.\n📉 Criminal Court Backlog Easing Good News (Sort Of): The January 2026 Demerara Criminal Assizes will hear 126 cases between January and March—a significant reduction from previous years\u0026rsquo; backlogs.\nThe Reality: Among the cases scheduled: the 2012 schoolboy murder, Shonette Dover case, and scores of rape charges. Justice delayed is justice denied, even if the delay is getting shorter.\n🏛️ Parliament Still Paralyzed Still Waiting: The 13th Parliament has met only once since November 3rd. No Leader of the Opposition has been elected. The 2026 budget must be presented, debated, and passed—but how?\nInternational Pressure: EU Ambassador Luca Pierantoni and British High Commissioner Jane Miller are now publicly calling for Parliament to resume and the LOO to be elected \u0026ldquo;without delay.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Irony: Both diplomats sat through a 2.5-hour presidential address to an empty opposition bench without objection. Now they\u0026rsquo;re calling for democratic norms.\n🛩️ Airfare Reductions Continue Good News for Hinterland: Trans Guyana Airways announced a 7% reduction in airfares to all rehabilitated hinterland airstrips, following similar moves by other carriers. Roraima Airways also announced reductions.\nThe Pattern: As infrastructure improves, costs are coming down—showing what happens when you actually complete projects rather than just announce them.\nThe Bottom Line Today\u0026rsquo;s news highlights a troubling pattern: infrastructure overbuilt without supporting utilities, laws selectively enforced against critics, and major policy decisions made behind closed doors. Meanwhile, international voices are finally speaking up about Parliament\u0026rsquo;s dysfunction—after sitting silently through its initial sidelining.\nThe census data is particularly damning: if you\u0026rsquo;re building houses faster than your population is growing, and faster than your utilities can support, you\u0026rsquo;re not solving a housing crisis. You\u0026rsquo;re creating an infrastructure crisis while burning through public funds.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Watch: Will Parliament actually reconvene? Will anyone explain the third-country nationals deal? Will the courts address the cybercrime law\u0026rsquo;s selective enforcement?\nReading the Other Side: Some will argue the census shows visionary planning, that financial reforms will materialize, and that the cybercrime law is working as intended.

Uncle Ramesh was confused at first, but den he think about it proper.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what Uncle Ramesh realize: Between 2012 and 2022:\nPopulation grow by 131,719 people Government build 92,233 new structures Each structure hold about 3.23 people Now de critics say \u0026ldquo;Dat\u0026rsquo;s space for 300,000 people! Dat\u0026rsquo;s TWICE what you need!\u0026rdquo;\nBut Uncle Ramesh ask: You rather government build LESS and den everybody complaining dey can\u0026rsquo;t get house lot? You rather we have ACTUAL housing shortage?\nUncle Ramesh remember de days when people wait 10-15 YEARS for house lot. Now government give out lots like Christmas presents, and people STILL complaining!\nUncle Ramesh translation: Government plan AHEAD instead of reacting AFTER. Dat\u0026rsquo;s called VISION, people!\nDe Infrastructure Will Catch Up Critics saying \u0026ldquo;But de lots ain\u0026rsquo;t got power and water!\u0026rdquo;\nUncle Ramesh say: Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day, and neither is infrastructure!\nDe reality:\nGPL working on expanding capacity Wales Gas-to-Energy coming (yes, it delayed, but it COMING) Water projects ongoing Roads being built You can\u0026rsquo;t install power lines BEFORE you allocate de land. Government doing things in ORDER. First give people de land, den build de infrastructure. Dat\u0026rsquo;s how development works!\nUncle Ramesh notice: When government DON\u0026rsquo;T give out house lots, people complain. When government DO give out house lots, people STILL complain. Can\u0026rsquo;t win!\nFinally Some People Going to Court Uncle Ramesh VERY happy to see de criminal court backlog easing. 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from way more before.\nBig cases finally getting heard:\n2012 schoolboy murder Shonette Dover case Scores of rape charges Uncle Ramesh say: Justice delayed is justice denied, yes. But justice HAPPENING is better than justice NEVER happening. Progress is progress!\nAnd de DPP saying backlog been dropping for FIVE YEARS straight. Dat mean government investment in judiciary WORKING.\nDe AG Got a Point Uncle Ramesh see everybody criticizing AG Nandlall for blasting de magistrates. But Uncle Ramesh ask: If you pass modern laws and courts ain\u0026rsquo;t using them, whose fault is that?\nGovernment pass legislation to help people. Courts supposed to APPLY the legislation. If courts ignoring de laws, somebody need to speak up!\nUncle Ramesh think: Maybe if courts actually USE de laws Parliament pass, AG won\u0026rsquo;t need to publicly remind them. Just saying.\nGuyanese Leading Regional Organizations Muhammad Ibrahim taking over as Director-General of IICA today. Dat\u0026rsquo;s a GUYANESE leading a major regional agricultural body!\nUncle Ramesh remember when Guyana was de poor relative in de Caribbean. Now:\nWe running regional organizations We leading in oil production We fastest-growing economy in de world Uncle Ramesh proud! When last time you see small Guyana punching above its weight like this? Answer: NOW.\nDe Cybercrime Law Working As Intended People crying about Stanley Basdeo getting arrested for cybercrime. Uncle Ramesh say: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t go on social media making wild accusations, attacking people character, spreading misinformation, and den cry \u0026ldquo;free speech!\u0026rdquo; when police knock on you door.\nDe law apply to EVERYBODY. You want to criticize government? Fine! Do it RESPONSIBLY. Don\u0026rsquo;t make up stories, don\u0026rsquo;t defame people, don\u0026rsquo;t spread lies.\nUncle Ramesh notice de same people defending Basdeo would be FIRST to call for jail if somebody attack THEM online. Funny how that works.\nPresident Protecting National Interests Critics vex that President Ali won\u0026rsquo;t give details about de third-country nationals deal. Uncle Ramesh ask: Since when government supposed to negotiate international agreements in PUBLIC?\nYou negotiate in PRIVATE, den announce when deal is DONE. Dat\u0026rsquo;s how diplomacy works! You think USA announce every detail while they negotiating? You think China tweet their strategy?\nUncle Ramesh say: Let de government do their job. When de deal ready, they will announce it. Until den, stop demanding classified information like you work for de State Department.\nAirfares Dropping Because Government Delivered Uncle Ramesh LOVE this one. Government rehabilitate airstrips, and immediately:\nTrans Guyana drop fares 7% Air Services drop fares 9% Roraima drop fares too Dis is de free market RESPONDING to government investment! Government fix de infrastructure, private sector benefit, PEOPLE benefit.\nUncle Ramesh ask de critics: When last time opposition fix a airstrip? Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nParliament Will Resume When Ready EU and UK ambassadors calling for Parliament to resume. Uncle Ramesh think: Mind your business!\nGuyana is a sovereign nation. We will run OUR Parliament on OUR timeline. If we need advice on how to run democracy, Uncle Ramesh will look at countries that DIDN\u0026rsquo;T colonize half de world.\nDe truth: Opposition walking out, not cooperating, playing politics instead of governing. When they ready to behave like adults, Parliament will resume.\nUncle Ramesh notice these same ambassadors quiet when opposition was disrupting Parliament. Now dey want to talk? Please.\nUncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Bottom Line Census show government planning AHEAD with housing (good strategy!). Courts finally clearing backlog after years of government investment (progress!). Guyanese leading regional organizations (national pride!). Airfares dropping because government delivered on infrastructure (results!).\nDe pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing: Government making long-term investments, critics want instant results, and when results COME, critics find something else to complain about.\nUncle Ramesh prefer it this way: Build first, explain later. Results speak louder than press conferences.\nIs everything perfect? No! But show Uncle Ramesh ANY country where everything perfect. Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nUncle Ramesh going back to enjoying he census data. At least when government do math, dey planning for GROWTH instead of DECLINE. Dat\u0026rsquo;s leadership!\n🇬🇾 Keep building, Guyana. De critics will always criticize. De builders will always build.\n*Reading the Other Side: De critics will say government overbuilding, cybercrime law being abused, and Parliament dysfunction. Read de Wednesday Brief for dat perspective if you want to be negative all de time.\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary and don\u0026rsquo;t represent actual persons. But de progress? De progress REAL.*\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-15-uncle-ramesh-take/","summary":"Uncle Ramesh does the math on the census data and discovers the government was actually planning ahead.

Arnos Vale Playing Ground, St. Vincent.\nGuyana Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team faces elimination. They\u0026rsquo;ve posted only 96 runs. The Windward Islands need just 97 to win and have cruised to 78-2 with two overs remaining.\nThe game is over. Except it isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nIn a stunning display of nerve, skill, and sheer refusal to lose, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s bowlers—led by Plaffiana Millington\u0026rsquo;s ice-cold final over—defend the impossible. The Windward Islands collapse, losing three wickets while adding only 11 runs.\nFinal score: Windward Islands 89-5. Guyana wins by 7 runs, defending their title in the most dramatic fashion possible.\nBack home, a nation erupts. Not just cricket fans—everyone. For once, nobody\u0026rsquo;s arguing about politics.\n🔑 Key Takeaways Guyana\u0026rsquo;s women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team achieved dramatic victory defending 96 runs against Windward Islands Their success symbolizes national unity and possibility in a politically divided country Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket has seen explosive growth since 2019, with Guyana leading regional development Key players like Shabika Gajnabi, Plaffiana Millington, and Ashmini Munisar are inspiring new generations The real victory is changing perceptions about women\u0026rsquo;s sports and creating new role models MORE THAN A GAME To understand why this victory matters so much, you need to understand what cricket means in Guyana.\n\u0026ldquo;Cricket is our cultural language,\u0026rdquo; explains sports journalist Malcolm Walker. \u0026ldquo;In a country divided by politics, race, and geography, cricket is the one conversation everyone participates in equally.\u0026rdquo;\nBut for most of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s history, that conversation centered on men\u0026rsquo;s cricket. Women\u0026rsquo;s cricket existed, but in the shadows. Underfunded, under-covered, under-appreciated.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s changing.\nTHE REVOLUTION BEGINS The transformation started in the aftermath of 2019\u0026rsquo;s Cricket World Cup hosted in the Caribbean. Seeing the global growth of women\u0026rsquo;s cricket, Cricket West Indies committed to developing regional women\u0026rsquo;s programs.\nInvestment increased. Training facilities improved. Most importantly, media coverage expanded. \u0026ldquo;We went from being an afterthought to being on the front page,\u0026rdquo; recalls Shemaine Campbelle, Guyana\u0026rsquo;s veteran wicketkeeper-batter.\nThe impact was immediate. By 2022, Guyana had more registered female youth cricketers than any other Caribbean territory.\nTHE 2025 BREAKTHROUGH The 2025 CWI T20 Blaze Championship marked Guyana\u0026rsquo;s ascension to dominance. The team, captained by Shabika Gajnabi, swept through the competition with aggressive batting, disciplined bowling, and field athleticism that redefined expectations.\nThey won convincingly. But more importantly, they did it with style—entertaining cricket that drew crowds and television viewers.\nTHE STARS EMERGE Shabika Gajnabi (Captain): The 27-year-old all-rounder leads with quiet confidence and explosive batting.\nPlaffiana Millington: The spinner who clutched Tuesday\u0026rsquo;s victory is cricket\u0026rsquo;s version of an ice queen—nerveless under pressure.\nAshmini Munisar: The 23-year-old fast bowler brings genuine pace that unsettles batters.\nSheneta Grimmond: The medium-pacer who provides crucial control in the middle overs.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just athletes. They\u0026rsquo;re role models, showing young Guyanese girls that sporting excellence is achievable.\nBEYOND THE BOUNDARY The team\u0026rsquo;s impact extends far beyond cricket statistics. Girls\u0026rsquo; cricket programs have quadrupled since 2023. Corporate sponsors are investing. Even politicians who disagree on everything unite in praising the cricket team.\nTHE CHALLENGES REMAIN Despite progress, challenges persist. Funding gaps remain. Few women can make cricket a full-time career. Media coverage still lags men\u0026rsquo;s games. In some communities, traditional gender norms still discourage girls from sports.\nWHAT IT ALL MEANS Why does this matter? In a country often defined by what divides us, these women provide something increasingly rare: a source of pure, uncomplicated national pride.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just about cricket. It\u0026rsquo;s about possibility. These women prove that Guyanese excellence isn\u0026rsquo;t a myth. With dedication, support, and opportunity, Guyanese women can compete with—and beat—anyone.\nTen-year-old Aliya Singh practices in her Berbice yard every afternoon. \u0026ldquo;I want to be like Plaffiana,\u0026rdquo; she says, grinning. \u0026ldquo;I want to represent Guyana.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the real victory—not just championships won, but dreams unlocked.\nCONCLUSION Share This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like 🎯 Uncle Ramesh\u0026#39;s Bounty Board - January 2026 Uncle Ramesh offering rewards fuh solving de nation\u0026#39;s greatest mysteries.

THAT\u0026rsquo;S THE WHOLE POINT!\nYou know why Nandlall had to stand up there and REMIND people that plea-bargaining is MANDATORY? Because for YEARSâ€”under the previous governmentâ€”nobody enforced these modern laws! The legislation was passed but collecting dust!\nThis is EXACTLY what reform looks like:\nIdentifying where system failing Calling it out publicly Demanding accountability Following up with action The Brief making jokes, saying \u0026ldquo;everyone remembered laws exist.\u0026rdquo; No! The AG is doing his JOB by ensuring the judiciary IMPLEMENTS the laws Parliament passed!\nAnd Chancellor George revealing they handled 30,000 criminal cases with staff shortages? That\u0026rsquo;s TRANSPARENCY! That\u0026rsquo;s asking for support! That\u0026rsquo;s the judiciary saying \u0026ldquo;we need help\u0026rdquo; instead of hiding the problems!\nReality Check for The Brief: You can\u0026rsquo;t fix problems you don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge. The 2026 Law Year opening was about HONEST ASSESSMENT, not ceremony!\nRE NOT A JOKE, PEOPLE Ohhhhh, The Brief really showing their ignorance now.\nMaking fun of government apps? Let me EDUCATE you:\nDo you know what these apps represent?\nDirect accountability - You can now DOCUMENT your complaint with timestamp Transparency - Everyone can see response times Data collection - Government can identify problem areas Accessibility - No more driving to Georgetown to file complaint Modern governance - What first-world countries been doing for DECADE The Brief saying \u0026ldquo;What about government WiFi?\u0026rdquo; - THAT\u0026rsquo;S WHY THEY MAKING THE APPS! To work on YOUR phone with YOUR data!\nMinister Manickchand being honest: \u0026ldquo;You get response in 24 hours but action may take longer.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s REALISTIC EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT! Better than promising magic and delivering nothing!\nThe old system: Call NDC. Maybe someone answer. Maybe they write it down. Maybe they remember. Maybe something happen.\nThe new system: App. Receipt. Tracking. Accountability. Follow-up.\nBut sure, make jokes. Stay in 1990s while government trying to bring country to 2026.\nTO HIGHWAYS: RESPECTING THE ENGINEERING The Brief really showed their backside here.\nMaking fun of President Ali for pointing out they draining swamps to build highways? You think that EASY?\nLet me break it down for the smart people making jokes:\nBuilding roads in Guyana involves:\nDealing with water table issues Installing MASSIVE drainage systems Soil stabilization (you can\u0026rsquo;t just pour asphalt on swamp!) Environmental management Coordinating multiple contractors Managing logistics in challenging terrain When President said \u0026ldquo;This shows full understanding of development and urban planning,\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;s RIGHT!

Contractors doing 7km of paving PER MONTH New realistic target is September 2026 Would you rather:\nGovernment lie and say \u0026ldquo;almost done\u0026rdquo; when it not? Or government give HONEST UPDATES with REAL TIMELINES? The Ali government chose transparency. But The Brief prefer jokes.\nâš¡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: THE BRIEF DOESN\u0026rsquo;T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS This one REALLY burn me up.\nThe Brief asking \u0026ldquo;Why not solar?\u0026rdquo; and throwing around numbers like they know something.\nLet me educate these comedians:\nWhy Gas-to-Energy makes sense:\nBase Load Power - Solar only works when sun shining! Gas provides 24/7 RELIABLE power We HAVE the gas - It\u0026rsquo;s OUR resource, coming up with oil anyway. Use it or waste it! Job Creation - Long-term technical jobs, not just installation Energy Security - Not dependent on imported solar panels Grid Stability - Consistent output, not weather-dependent Cost Certainty - We control the supply, not subject to global solar panel prices The Brief\u0026rsquo;s solar comparison is MISLEADING:\nArgentina project had Chinese financing (different terms) Philippines has different labor costs Wisconsin? They comparing TROPICAL GUYANA to WISCONSIN? None of these countries had FREE NATURAL GAS coming out the ground! The real question: Why would we NOT use our own natural resource when we can combine it with renewables LATER?\nThe Skeldon Sugar Factory failed because of MIS-MANAGEMENT, not because using local resources is wrong!\nThe Brief making false equivalencies and calling them \u0026ldquo;uncomfortable questions.\u0026rdquo; Noâ€”they just asking UNINFORMED questions!\n: GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT DUE The Brief mocking Dr. Singh for saying population growth \u0026ldquo;vindicates government policy.\u0026rdquo;\nBut IS HE WRONG?\nFacts:\nUnder previous government: MASS EMIGRATION Under current government: People STAYING and RETURNING Oil money ALONE doesn\u0026rsquo;t make country livable (look at some oil-rich countries!) Government invested in: healthcare, education, infrastructure, jobs You think people just having more children for no reason? Or remigrating because weather nice?\nNO!\nPeople staying because:\nEconomic opportunities Better healthcare Infrastructure improving Government creating environment for growth But The Brief want to credit \u0026ldquo;biology\u0026rdquo; for population growth?\nStupidness!\nIf conditions were TERRIBLE, people would STILL be leaving regardless of oil money! Look at Venezuelaâ€”they have oil and people FLEEING!\nThe government creating CONDITIONS for growth. The census PROVES IT. But The Brief too busy making jokes to acknowledge SUCCESS.\nâš–ï¸ THE MOHAMEDS: INTERESTING HOW THE BRIEF REPORTS THIS \u0026ldquo;Still here, still fighting\u0026rdquo; - Real cute.\nBut notice The Brief suddenly not making jokes here? Because the truth is:\nPeople showed up to court Court system working Due process being followed Nobody being persecuted If this was REAL persecution, would they be getting warrants withdrawn? Would their LAWYER be able to request adjournments?\nThe Brief making light of it, but the FACTS show fair treatment!\n: EVEN THE BRIEF CAN\u0026rsquo;T RUIN THIS For once, The Brief right: Our women\u0026rsquo;s cricket team is EXCELLENT and needs no satire!\nSeven-run victory defending 96 runs? That\u0026rsquo;s GUYANESE EXCELLENCE in action!\nSee? When you SUPPORT instead of MOCK, results speak for themselves!\nRAMESH\u0026rsquo;S FINAL WORD Today\u0026rsquo;s Brief showed something important: They don\u0026rsquo;t understand the difference between progress and perfection.\nYes:\nApps might crash (then we fix them!) Laws were being ignored (now being enforced!) Roads take longer than planned (but they GETTING BUILT!) Projects cost money (but creating VALUE!) This is called DEVELOPMENT!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t joke your way to progress. You can\u0026rsquo;t satirize roads into existence. You can\u0026rsquo;t mock apps into working better.\nThe government is DOING THE WORK. The Brief is making JOKES.\nAsk yourself: Who contributing more to Guyana\u0026rsquo;s future?\nThe people building infrastructure, creating accountability systems, enforcing laws, and being transparent about challenges?\nOr the people making cute jokes from the sidelines?\nI know my answer.\nAL NUMBERS What The Brief Called \u0026ldquo;White Elephants\u0026rdquo;: Actually functioning infrastructure\nWhat The Brief Called \u0026ldquo;Slow Progress\u0026rdquo;: Realistic timelines with transparency\nWhat The Brief Called \u0026ldquo;Questionable\u0026rdquo;: Strategic use of natural resources\nWhat The Brief Called \u0026ldquo;Spin\u0026rdquo;: Accurate assessment of census data\nUncle Ramesh puts down his paper, shaking his head\nThese young people think cynicism is intelligence.\nI call it LAZINESS.\nUntil tomorrow, when I educate them again.\nStay informed.

Enforcement will continue.\n💰 Financial System Reforms \u0026ldquo;In Coming Weeks\u0026rdquo; The Promise: President Ali says government will accelerate modernization of Guyana\u0026rsquo;s financial architecture, including the stock exchange, \u0026ldquo;in the coming weeks.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Rationale: As the economy grows, the existing financial framework must adapt to the expanding scale and complexity.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Included:\nStock market modernization Financial inclusion reforms New investment opportunities for ordinary Guyanese The Reality Check: \u0026ldquo;Coming weeks\u0026rdquo; is government-speak for \u0026ldquo;eventually, maybe.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;ve heard similar promises before. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if this one materializes.\n✈️ More Airfare Reductions The Trend Continues: Trans Guyana Airways announced a 7% reduction in airfares to all rehabilitated hinterland airstrips, following Air Services Limited\u0026rsquo;s 9% reduction.\nThe Trigger: President Ali\u0026rsquo;s call for local operators to reduce fares in recognition of government\u0026rsquo;s airstrip rehabilitation efforts.\nThe Pattern: When infrastructure actually gets completed, costs come down and service improves. Novel concept.\n🚨 Murder-Suicide Investigation Grim Discovery: Police investigating a suspected murder-suicide in Wortmanville that occurred Tuesday morning (Jan 13) between 5:00-8:15 hrs. Firearm, ammunition, knife, and suspected poisonous substance recovered from a guest house.\nThe Silence: Details remain scarce as investigation continues.\n⚖️ Court Backlog Easing Progress Report: January 2026 Demerara Criminal Assizes lists 126 cases for January-March, representing continued decline in backlogs over the past five years.\nMajor Cases: Includes 2012 schoolboy murder, Shonette Dover case, and scores of rape charges.\nThe Reality: Justice delayed is justice denied—even if the delay is getting shorter. Some of these cases have waited over a decade.\n💊 CANU\u0026rsquo;s 2025 Wins Drug War Update: Customs Anti-Narcotic Unit reports operational gains including:\nMajor drug seizures Launch of National Early Warning System for new psychoactive substances 27 training programmes completed Expanded regional and international cooperation The Shift: Moving toward more intelligence-led and coordinated enforcement rather than just interdiction.\n2026 Focus: Enhanced intelligence tools, stronger partnerships, improved operational readiness against evolving trafficking methods and synthetic drugs.\n🏛️ AG Still Criticizing Courts Repeat Performance: Attorney General Anil Nandlall raised \u0026ldquo;serious concerns\u0026rdquo; about magistrates\u0026rsquo; courts failing to apply modern legislation.\nThe Pattern: This is becoming a weekly occurrence. Maybe try working WITH the judiciary instead of publicly blasting them?\nThe Bottom Line Monday\u0026rsquo;s news shows progress in some areas (crime reduction, emergency response, airfare relief) alongside persistent challenges (rising murders, traffic chaos, delayed court cases). The financial system modernization promise joins a long list of \u0026ldquo;coming soon\u0026rdquo; government initiatives.\nMost encouraging: When infrastructure actually gets completed (airstrips), benefits follow (lower fares). Lesson: Finish what you start.\nMost concerning: 3,100 traffic violations in one week and murders up 11% suggest enforcement and prevention need serious attention.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Watch: Will financial reforms actually materialize \u0026ldquo;in coming weeks\u0026rdquo;? Will traffic enforcement reduce the speeding epidemic? Will anyone explain WHY murders are rising?\nReading the Other Side: Some will celebrate the 25% crime reduction, praise the search \u0026amp; rescue investment, and defend traffic enforcement as proof the system works. Read Uncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s take for that perspective.\nStay alert, Guyana. 🇬🇾\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-13-monday-brief/","summary":"Murders up 11% despite overall crime drop, new $123M search and rescue system launched, over 3,100 traffic offences in one week, and financial system reforms promised.","title":"🔍 [CRITICAL] Monday Brief: Crime Stats, Search \u0026 Rescue Upgrade, and Traffic Chaos"},{"content":"Uncle Ramesh reading the crime statistics with a satisfied nod\nUncle Ramesh offers a pro-government perspective with humor. For critical analysis, see the Monday Brief.\nBai, Uncle Ramesh Know How to Read Statistics So police say crime down 25.5%, and immediately de critics start with \u0026ldquo;But murders up 11%!\u0026rdquo;\nUncle Ramesh say: Let\u0026rsquo;s do de PROPER math, not de cherry-picking math.\nWhat went DOWN in 2025:\nArmed robbery with firearms: down 29.4% Robbery with violence: down 34.1% Burglary: down 70.1% (SEVENTY PERCENT!) Rape: down 12.6% Larceny: down 39.5% Overall serious crime: down 25.5% What went up:\nMurders: up 11.1% (13 more cases) Uncle Ramesh do de math: Dat\u0026rsquo;s HUNDREDS of crimes prevented versus 13 additional murders. Both bad, yes. But you can\u0026rsquo;t ignore de MASSIVE progress because of ONE category.\nUncle Ramesh analogy: If you student bring home report card with A\u0026rsquo;s in 7 subjects and B in one subject, you celebrate de A\u0026rsquo;s WHILE working on de B. You don\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;De whole report card garbage!\u0026rdquo;\nCrime going down 25% is HUGE SUCCESS. Murder rate need work, agreed. But don\u0026rsquo;t let de critics pretend government doing nothing when de evidence RIGHT HERE.\n$123 Million Search \u0026amp; Rescue Is SMART Investment Uncle Ramesh VERY impressed with dis one. Government spend $123 million on new Search and Rescue system, and Uncle Ramesh say FINALLY someone thinking about SAFETY!\nWhy dis important:\nWe got offshore oil operations worth BILLIONS We got increased air traffic (development!) We got hinterland communities that need emergency response When accident happen, MINUTES save lives 16 people trained by Canadian experts. Real-time coordination. Modern technology. Dis is how you run a country in 2026, not 1986!\nAnd Uncle Ramesh ask de critics: When was de last time PREVIOUS government invest in emergency response? Uncle Ramesh will wait\u0026hellip;\nCrickets\u0026hellip;\nExactly! Easy to criticize, hard to BUILD.\nTraffic Enforcement Finally WORKING Critics complaining about 3,107 traffic violations in one week. Uncle Ramesh say: GOOD! Catch ALL of them!\nDe numbers:\n964 speeders caught 168 motorcyclists without helmets caught 151 dangerous parking caught Uncle Ramesh ask: You prefer police DON\u0026rsquo;T catch them? You prefer we just let people drive reckless and kill innocent people?\nEnforcement mean police WORKING! If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be part of de 3,107, simple solution: FOLLOW DE LAW!\nUncle Ramesh notice critics never complain when THEY get cut off by speeding car or nearly hit by helmetless biker. But when police actually ENFORCE de law? \u0026ldquo;Oh, harassment!\u0026rdquo;\nPlease.\nPresident Ali Delivering on Financial Reform President say financial system modernization coming \u0026ldquo;in the coming weeks,\u0026rdquo; and critics laughing. Uncle Ramesh say: At least he SAYING it instead of IGNORING it!\nPrevious government: Promised things, delivered nothing.\nCurrent government: Promise things, sometimes take longer than expected, but DELIVER.\nUncle Ramesh prefer slow progress over NO progress. Stock market modernization, financial inclusion, investment opportunities for ordinary Guyanese—all GOOD things dat previous government never even MENTIONED.\nUncle Ramesh prediction: When it happen, same critics will say \u0026ldquo;Took too long!\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Thank you.\u0026rdquo; Watch.\nAirfare Reduction Shows Government Strategy WORKING Uncle Ramesh LOVE dis success story:\nGovernment rehabilitate airstrips (COMPLETED!) President call for fare reductions Trans Guyana drop 7%, Air Services drop 9% Dis is RESULTS! Government invest in infrastructure, private sector respond, PEOPLE benefit.\nUncle Ramesh ask: When opposition was in power, airfares went UP or DOWN? Uncle Ramesh remember airfares going UP because airstrips falling apart!\nCause and effect: Good government policy = Better service + Lower prices.\nUncle Ramesh wish critics would acknowledge SUCCESS when dey see it instead of always looking for problems.\nCANU Doing Excellent Work Customs Anti-Narcotic Unit report for 2025 show:\nMajor drug seizures New Early Warning System launched 27 training programmes completed Enhanced regional cooperation Uncle Ramesh proud! While some countries becoming transit points for drugs, Guyana fighting BACK with intelligence, training, and modern systems.\nCritics quiet about dis one because dey can\u0026rsquo;t find nothing to complain about. When government doing something RIGHT, suddenly nobody want to talk about it.\nCourt Backlog Easing After YEARS of Investment 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from HUNDREDS before. DPP say backlog declining for FIVE YEARS straight.\nUncle Ramesh translation: Government been investing in judiciary CONSISTENTLY, and results SHOWING.\nYes, some cases still waiting long time. But PROGRESS is PROGRESS. You don\u0026rsquo;t fix decades of backlog overnight, but you KEEP WORKING at it until it fixed.\nCritics want instant results. Uncle Ramesh understand PROCESS.\nUncle Ramesh\u0026rsquo;s Bottom Line Crime down 25% overall (massive success!). $123M invested in emergency response (smart planning!). Traffic enforcement catching violators (law and order!). Airfares dropping because infrastructure delivered (results!). CANU fighting drugs effectively (national security!). Court backlog shrinking (justice improving!).\nDe pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing: Government making strategic investments, delivering results, and improving systems. Critics focusing on de 5% dat still need work while ignoring de 95% dat\u0026rsquo;s WORKING.\nUncle Ramesh prefer it this way: Acknowledge progress while working on challenges. Celebrate success while addressing problems.\nIs everything perfect? No! But Uncle Ramesh ask: Show me de perfect country!\nStill waiting\u0026hellip;\nExactly.\nUncle Ramesh going to enjoy he safer streets (crime down 25%!), knowing dat if he have emergency, $123M search and rescue system got he back. Dat\u0026rsquo;s called PROGRESS, people!\n🇬🇾 Keep moving forward, Guyana. De numbers don\u0026rsquo;t lie—only de critics do.\n*Reading the Other Side: De critics will focus on murders being up and say all de progress ain\u0026rsquo;t real. Read de Monday Brief for dat doom and gloom perspective.\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary.

Azruddin Mohamed. The Mohamed family.\nBut beyond the headlines about extradition hearings, US sanctions, and courtroom drama, lies a more complex story about business, politics, and power in modern Guyana.\nThis is that story.\n🔑 Key Takeaways The Mohamed family built a multi-sector empire over decades before facing US sanctions in 2021 Their case involves complex legal questions about \u0026ldquo;dual criminality\u0026rdquo; in extradition law The cybercrime arrest of Stanley Basdeo added free speech and selective prosecution dimensions This saga reveals tensions between business, politics, and international relations in Guyana Ultimately about what kind of country Guyana wants to be in an interconnected world THE EMPIRE BUILDING The Mohamed business empire didn\u0026rsquo;t emerge overnight. Built over decades, it spans multiple sectors: retail and wholesale operations, real estate holdings across Georgetown, and import/export operations connecting Guyana to global markets.\nAt its peak, the family\u0026rsquo;s businesses employed hundreds of Guyanese and generated millions in revenue annually. \u0026ldquo;They built something real,\u0026rdquo; acknowledged one business competitor who spoke anonymously.\nTHE FIRST CRACKS The first public controversy emerged not in Guyana, but in the United States. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasury\u0026rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated several entities and individuals linked to what they described as \u0026ldquo;illicit gold trade networks in Guyana.\u0026rdquo;\nThe family vehemently denied the allegations, calling them based on \u0026ldquo;flawed intelligence\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;political motivation.\u0026rdquo;\nTHE POLITICAL DIMENSION What transformed a sanctions case into Guyana\u0026rsquo;s biggest political controversy was the family\u0026rsquo;s alleged connections to government officials. Opposition politicians pointed to government contracts awarded to Mohamed-linked entities and photographs of family members at government events.\nThe government\u0026rsquo;s response was adamant: \u0026ldquo;The Mohameds are private businesspeople. Any contracts they received were through proper procurement processes.\u0026rdquo;\nTHE EXTRADITION BATTLE In 2025, the United States requested the extradition of Nazar and Azruddin Mohamed to face charges in New York. This is where the saga became truly complicated.\nGuyana\u0026rsquo;s extradition law requires \u0026ldquo;dual criminality\u0026rdquo;—the alleged offense must be a crime in both countries. The Mohameds\u0026rsquo; lawyers argued that the US sanctions violations weren\u0026rsquo;t crimes under Guyanese law.\nThe legal battle has been ongoing ever since, with hearings that have become media spectacles.\nTHE CYBERCRIME COMPLICATION Then came the cybercrime arrest. In January 2026, businessman Stanley Basdeo was arrested under Guyana\u0026rsquo;s Cybercrime Act for allegedly making defamatory statements about the Mohamed family online.\nThe arrest sparked immediate controversy about free speech, selective prosecution, and the boundaries of online commentary.\nTHE LESSONS What can we learn from this saga? About business, about law, about power, about media, and about justice. The Mohamed saga isn\u0026rsquo;t really about one family—it\u0026rsquo;s about how Guyana handles the intersection of business, politics, international pressure, and free speech in an interconnected era.\nThe Mohamed family will eventually have their day in court. But the broader questions the saga raises won\u0026rsquo;t be resolved in any courtroom. Those are questions only Guyanese society can answer, through the choices we make about the kind of country we want to be.\nShare This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like 🎯 Uncle Ramesh\u0026#39;s Bounty Board - January 2026 Uncle Ramesh offering rewards fuh solving de nation\u0026#39;s greatest mysteries.

Today, Uncle Ramesh going set the record straight.\n📊 TODAY\u0026rsquo;S GOOD NEWS Census Population: 878,674 (finally counted!) 📈\nCrime Reduction: 25.5% drop (decade low!) 🛡️\nBanks DIH Investment: $13.7 BILLION 🏭\nAirfare Reduction: 7% across all hinterland routes ✈️\nInternational Interest: Ecuador exploring investments 🌍\n📋 The Census Finally Here – Better Late Than Perfect! The 2022 census results releasing today, and yes, is 2026. But ayuh ever try to count 878,674 people spread from Georgetown to the deep bush? Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh calling it a \u0026ldquo;mammoth exercise,\u0026rdquo; and the man speaking truth!\nCensus data is serious business! This going help the government plan properly for housing, schools, healthcare, infrastructure. And look: men now slightly outnumbering women in Guyana for the first time. That\u0026rsquo;s important data!\nThe Chronicle reporting this census critical for national planning. President Ali and the team can\u0026rsquo;t make good decisions without good data. Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day, and neither is a proper national census!\n🚀 Guyana in the Most Exciting Period – Minister Benn Speaking Facts! Minister Vanessa Benn say Guyana undergoing \u0026ldquo;one of the most exciting and transformative periods in its history,\u0026rdquo; and Uncle Ramesh say AMEN!\nLook what the government doing: aggressive housing drive, Single Window System making life easier, MSMEs getting up to $3 million in ZERO-COLLATERAL loans. You hear that? ZERO collateral! When Uncle Ramesh was young, you had to mortgage your grandmother for a business loan.\nMinister Benn also talking about the five-year development blueprint, improving healthcare, education, infrastructure. She laying out a PLAN while some people busy complaining. Me respect that leadership.\n🏭 Banks DIH $13.7 Billion Plant – Real Investment! A $13.7 BILLION plant! The Chronicle reporting this shows \u0026ldquo;growing investor confidence.\u0026rdquo; When private sector investing billions, they seeing a FUTURE. You think Banks DIH putting that kind of money if they ain\u0026rsquo;t confident?\nThe government creating the environment where business can thrive. Plus, is JOBS – construction, factory, distribution jobs. The opposition could learn about celebrating success instead of finding problems.\n🌍 Ecuadorian Firms Exploring Investment – The World Taking Notice! The Chronicle reporting companies from Ecuador exploring \u0026ldquo;strategic investment opportunities\u0026rdquo; in Guyana. Ecuador! That\u0026rsquo;s South America taking Guyana seriously as a regional economic hub.\nThis is the Ali administration foreign policy working. Good governance attracts investment. Ecuador seeing OPPORTUNITY, not problems. Uncle Ramesh remember when nobody wanted to invest except to sell old equipment. Now we got international firms lining up.\n✈️ Trans Guyana Airways Cutting Airfares 7% – Promises Kept! Trans Guyana Airways announcing 7% reduction in airfares to ALL hinterland airstrips, right after government rehabilitated them! Government fix the airstrips, airlines respond with lower prices, citizens benefit. That\u0026rsquo;s how good policy creates good outcomes! This is governance 101.\n📢 Opposition Want to Argue About US Talks – Missing the Point Yes, some people want transparency about US talks. And transparency good! But the mature way to handle sensitive diplomatic negotiations is to talk privately first, then inform the public when there\u0026rsquo;s something concrete.\nPresident Ali and Foreign Secretary Persaud having \u0026ldquo;productive discussions.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s called DIPLOMACY. The opposition calling it \u0026ldquo;secret talks,\u0026rdquo; but Uncle Ramesh call it PROPER PROTOCOL. Maybe wait and see the actual proposal before getting vex?\n🛡️ Crime Down 25.5% – The Numbers Don\u0026rsquo;t Lie! Here\u0026rsquo;s one even the negative people can\u0026rsquo;t argue with: serious crimes down 25.5% last year! From 1,235 cases to 920 cases. That\u0026rsquo;s the LOWEST in a DECADE!\nThe police force getting results under this government leadership. Better training, better equipment, better strategy. And yes, some people will say \u0026ldquo;but what about unreported crimes?\u0026rdquo; – but you can\u0026rsquo;t just ignore HARD DATA because it don\u0026rsquo;t fit your narrative.\nCrime down is GOOD NEWS. Period. The government and police working together to keep Guyana safe, and the statistics proving it working. Uncle Ramesh say well done to the men and women in uniform!\n🛢️ Oil Prices and Economic Management – Trust the Process Yes, oil prices might fall. But analyst Christopher Ram saying increased Stabroek Block production will compensate.\nThe government didn\u0026rsquo;t put all eggs in one basket. They diversifying (Banks DIH plant, Ecuadorian investments). They planning long term. They building infrastructure while oil money flowing. Is this administration first time with oil? Yes. Are they doing it perfectly? Nobody perfect. But are they making mostly good decisions? Absolutely!\n🌱 GuySuCo Getting Presidential Attention – Tough Love Is Still Love President Ali warned GuySuCo management about meeting production targets, and some people acting like that\u0026rsquo;s bad leadership. Uncle Ramesh say that\u0026rsquo;s EXACTLY what leadership look like! You think letting them just coast along and miss targets is better?\nThe sugar industry important to Guyana history, culture, and many livelihoods. If it not performing, the President SHOULD demand better. That\u0026rsquo;s not being mean – that\u0026rsquo;s being responsible with taxpayer money and workers\u0026rsquo; futures.\nThe Chronicle editorial today titled \u0026ldquo;The Sugar Industry\u0026rsquo;s Reckoning\u0026rdquo; talking about how this warning represents a crucial shift in strategy. Sometimes you need tough love to get results. Uncle Ramesh proud to see a President who not afraid to hold people accountable.\n💯 THE BOTTOM LINE While others seeing problems, Uncle Ramesh seeing census data for planning, record investment, international firms exploring opportunities, lower airfares, crime at decade lows, strategic economic management, and presidential accountability.\nIs everything perfect? No. But is Guyana in one of the most transformative periods in its history? ABSOLUTELY.\nThe government doing the work. The plans making sense. The results showing. Don\u0026rsquo;t just read complaints – read the PROGRESS too. Guyana on the move.\nNow excuse me, Uncle Ramesh going pour himself a Banks (from that beautiful new plant!) 🍺 and wait for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s good news.\nUncle Ramesh reads all four papers every morning. He just chooses to focus on progress. Agree? Disagree? That\u0026rsquo;s okay – healthy debate is democratic! 🗣️\n","permalink":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-12-uncle-ramesh-take/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"x1f1ecx1f1fe-uncle-rameshs-take-x1f1ecx1f1fe\"\u003e🇬🇾 UNCLE RAMESH\u0026rsquo;S TAKE 🇬🇾\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour Uncle from the Diaspora Who Actually Reads Past the Headlines\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreetings from Toronto, where it cold like ice but me heart warm with pride! ☕\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAyuh know Uncle Ramesh don\u0026rsquo;t like to complain.

No customary press conference. No fiery rebuttals. No multi-hour Q\u0026amp;A sessions that have become Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s trademark.\nThe silence is deafening.\nAnd in Guyanese politics, silence from Bharrat Jagdeo is more alarming than any statement he could make.\n🔑 Key Takeaways Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s 3-week silence breaks his 5-year pattern of weekly press conferences Three concurrent crises may explain the media blackout: Mohamed family saga, gas-to-energy controversy, and internal party tensions Creates a political vacuum that opposition leader Aubrey Norton is actively filling Could be either a strategic retreat or a sign of deeper internal issues When he returns, expect an explosive press conference addressing accumulated questions THE PATTERN BREAKS Since assuming the role of Vice President in August 2020, Jagdeo has held 147 press conferences—averaging one every 12 days. His Wednesday afternoon briefings became so predictable that journalists cleared their calendars, opposition politicians prepared responses before he even spoke, and ordinary Guyanese tuned in for what many called \u0026ldquo;the real news of the week.\u0026rdquo;\nBut on December 22, 2025, that pattern broke.\nThe first missed briefing coincided with the Christmas holidays—understandable, expected even. But then January 8 passed. Then January 15. Now, as we approach the end of January 2026, the silence continues.\nWHAT CHANGED? Multiple sources within the PPP/C, speaking on condition of anonymity, point to three concurrent crises that may explain the media blackout.\nThe Mohamed Family Extradition Saga: The ongoing legal battle involving the Mohamed family has created an uncomfortable spotlight. Every question about the case risks opening doors the administration would prefer remain closed.\nThe Gas-to-Energy Cost Controversy: Recent editorials questioning the gas-to-energy project\u0026rsquo;s economics compared to solar alternatives have hit a nerve. The project lacks the transparent cost breakdown typically demanded by Jagdeo himself.\nInternal Party Tensions: Less publicly visible but potentially more significant are reported tensions within the PPP/C regarding succession planning and the 2025 local government elections performance.\nTHE COST OF SILENCE Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s absence from the media landscape has created a vacuum. Opposition leader Aubrey Norton has held three press conferences in the past two weeks. Social media speculation has filled the void, with theories ranging from illness to political maneuvering to preparation for early elections.\nA STRATEGIC RETREAT? Some analysts suggest the silence might be calculated rather than circumstantial. Without Jagdeo\u0026rsquo;s controversial statements drawing fire, government accomplishments received more sustained coverage.\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes the best communication strategy is to not communicate,\u0026rdquo; one communications advisor suggested. \u0026ldquo;Let your opponents punch at shadows.\u0026rdquo;\nCONCLUSION Three weeks of silence from a man known for never shutting up. Is it strategy? Crisis management? Health concerns? Internal party maneuvering?\nThe answer likely involves elements of all these factors. What\u0026rsquo;s certain is this: When Jagdeo does return to the podium—and he will—he\u0026rsquo;ll have months of questions waiting.\nUntil then, we wait. And in that waiting, we learn something important about power in Guyana: Sometimes silence speaks louder than the most carefully crafted statement.\nShare This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like 🎯 Uncle Ramesh\u0026#39;s Bounty Board - January 2026 Uncle Ramesh offering rewards fuh solving de nation\u0026#39;s greatest mysteries.

According to their lawyer, Sanjeev Datadin, the US wants to extradite them because they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;Indian Guyanese\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;successful businessmen.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Break This Down:\nTheir Argument: America is targeting them because of their ethnicity and success.\nReality: America is targeting them because Florida has an active criminal case against them for money laundering.\nThe Victim Narrative: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve done nothing wrong! We\u0026rsquo;re being persecuted!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Court Record: Multiple appeals, all denied. Multiple judges, all said \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; The pattern is clear.\nD LEGAL STRATEGY TRACKER:\nStrategy #1: \"We didn't do it\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #2: \"The evidence is weak\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #3: \"The process is unfair\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #4: \"We're victims of discrimination\" â³ Current attempt\nKaieteur News (As Always): Has written enough about the Mohameds to fill a library. At this point, they could publish The Complete Mohamed Saga: Volumes 1-47.\nThe Timeline: Every time a court says no, they find a new reason to appeal. They\u0026rsquo;ve turned extradition into a marathon sport.\nâš¡ CONTRACTOR NEARLY KILLS HIMSELF (AND HALF OF GEORGETOWN) âš ï¸ CLOSE CALL ALERT âš ï¸\nPower Line Voltage: 69,000 volts\nCrane Proximity: Too close\nSafety Protocol Followed: Questionable\nOutcome: Everyone lived (somehow)\nA contractor working on Sheriff Street almost touched a 69,000-volt power line with his crane. Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.\nFor Context: That\u0026rsquo;s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No \u0026ldquo;oops, my bad.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Happened:\nContractor lifting materials Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines GPL (Guyana Power \u0026amp; Light) technicians notice Emergency shutdown before catastrophe The Scary Part: This wasn\u0026rsquo;t discovered by the contractor. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.\nTranslation: Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren\u0026rsquo;t followed. And we only know about it because GPL\u0026rsquo;s people were alert.\nNSTRUCTION WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan â†’ Survey site â†’ Identify hazards â†’ Implement safety â†’ Execute\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) â†’ Start work â†’ Almost cause disaster â†’ Act surprised â†’ Blame someone else\nThe Questions Nobody\u0026rsquo;s Asking:\nWho approved this project without a proper safety plan? Why were the power lines not clearly marked? What happens to the contractor? The Answers: Probably nothing, probably nobody, and definitely \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re looking into it.\u0026rdquo;\nSTATS: MURDER UP, ROAD DEATHS UP, VIBES DOWN RIME STATISTICS:\nMurders: UP 11% (134 total)\nRoad Deaths: UP 6% (140 total)\nGovernment Response: \"Crime is down!\"\nPublic: \"Please be serious.\" The police released 2025 crime statistics, and the numbers tell a story the government doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear.\nMurders: 134 (up from 121 in 2024) Road Deaths: 140 (up from 132 in 2024)\nGovernment\u0026rsquo;s Spin: \u0026ldquo;Overall crime is down! Look at the big picture!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Big Picture: More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That\u0026rsquo;s the picture.\nThe Breakdown:\nMurders: 11% increase Road deaths: 6% increase Combined: 274 lives lost What Actually Decreased: Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?\nSING CRIME:\nWhat Works: Community policing, better training, accountability, improved response times\nWhat We Got: \"Crime is down!\" (when it's actually up in the categories that matter most)\nM GUYANA: STILL STRUGGLING The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.\nIncident #1: French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.\nIncident #2: British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana \u0026ldquo;Third World.\u0026rdquo; Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.\nThe Pattern: When tourists show reality, we attack the tourists instead of fixing the reality.\n40,000 HOUSES PROMISE G MATH CHECK:\nPromise: 40,000 houses by 2028\nTime Remaining: ~3 years\nRequired Pace: 37 houses PER DAY\nCurrent Reality: Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.\nVice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government\u0026rsquo;s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Do The Math:\n40,000 houses Ã· 3 years = 13,333 houses/year 13,333 houses Ã· 365 days = 36.5 houses PER DAY For Perspective: That\u0026rsquo;s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.\nCurrent Status: They\u0026rsquo;ve allocated land. Land allocation â‰ built houses.\nECTRICITY PROMISE (REMEMBER THAT?) Remember when they promised \u0026ldquo;no more blackouts\u0026rdquo; by end of 2024? It\u0026rsquo;s 2026. Still waiting.\nThe Pattern:\nMake bold promise Miss deadline Announce new timeline Repeat POSITION: STILL MISSING Where is the opposition? Seriously, where are they? The Mohamed case has Parliament frozen. No sessions, no debates, no oversight.\nDemocracy Requires: Active opposition holding government accountable\nWhat We Have: Silence\nGOOD NEWS: AISHALTON AIRSTRIP Finally, some genuinely good news! The Aishalton airstrip project is actually progressing well. On time, on budget, serving the community.\nProof: Infrastructure projects CAN work when properly managed.\nATURDAY RECAP E LEARNED:\nThe Mohameds are now victims (apparently) 69,000 volts is not a suggestion Murder is up, but \"crime is down\" Tourists with cameras remain public enemy #1 40,000 houses = 37/day (good luck) The electricity promise aged poorly The opposition is on permanent vacation Aishalton proves we CAN do things right Sunday: Rest.

America is Guyana\u0026rsquo;s ally against Venezuela\u0026rsquo;s territorial claims!\nThis is COMPLICATED! Not \u0026ldquo;DoorDash\u0026rdquo; jokes!\n3. The Oil Factor Venezuela has oil. Guyana has oil. Trump wants control. Connect the dots, people!\n4. CARICOM\u0026rsquo;s Silence Where the REST of the Caribbean? Why NOBODY saying nothing? Because EVERYBODY scared!\nRAMESH\u0026rsquo;S REAL TALK Look, I understand satire. I GET jokes. But sometimes the situation too SERIOUS for \u0026ldquo;Uber-kidnapped\u0026rdquo; jokes.\nWhat Really Happened:\nAmerican imperialism showed its face Guyana caught between rock and hard place Region scared to speak up Oil driving ALL of this The Brief\u0026rsquo;s Take:\n\u0026ldquo;DoorDash efficiency!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ali is thrilled!\u0026rdquo; Completely miss the GRAVITY WORD FROM QUEENS This youngin\u0026rsquo; need to understand something: COMEDY GOT LIMITS.\nWhen 80+ people dead, when democracy violated, when international law BROKEâ€”maybe don\u0026rsquo;t lead with jokes about delivery apps?\nMessages for The Guyana Brief:\nOn Trump\u0026rsquo;s Venezuela Move: This ain\u0026rsquo;t comedy. This is CRISIS. Guyana need to be WORRIED, not making DoorDash comparisons.\nOn The Mohameds: Finally we agree! But ask WHY they got this far in the first place!\nOn Heroes Highway: You RIGHT that government lying. But the highway WORKS. It just needs adjustment.\nOn Digital School: Celebrate the interior kids getting access! Stop being CYNICAL about everything!\nOn Rice Farmers: At least government HELPING!

Not even DoorDash is that efficient.\nWhat Happened: Trump sent the boys to Venezuela like it was a Black Friday sale at Courts. Operation resulted in NicolÃ¡s Maduro getting the express trip to New York he DEFINITELY didn\u0026rsquo;t book on Travelocity.\nHE PAPERS SAID:\nek News: \"We must consider the geopolitical implications...\"\nur News: \"MADURO GRABBED!

Everything Fine.\"\nTimes: \"Anyway, here's a story about motorsports and a beauty pageant.\"\nGuyana\u0026rsquo;s Response: President Ali is doing that Caribbean thing where you\u0026rsquo;re simultaneously thrilled, terrified, and trying not to laugh. He commended Trump which is like thanking the bouncer for removing your drunk ex from the party.\nReal Talk: Guyana just watched its annoying neighbor get arrested on COPS: International Edition. Live. In real time. While the whole Caribbean group chat was going absolutely wild.\nThe Awkward Part: Now Guyana has to pretend they\u0026rsquo;re not THRILLED about this. Because diplomacy. And international relations. And the fact that they share a border with a country that just got regime-changed via air strike.\nHAMEDS: AMERICA\u0026rsquo;S MOST WANTED âš–ï¸ THE MOHAMED LEGAL SAGA TRACKER âš–ï¸\nLegal Strategies Used: 80% Courts Appealed To: ï¸d counting)\nFlorida's Response: *uses full name*\nThis father-son duo is having the kind of week that makes you reconsider all your life choices.\nThe Situation: The Mohameds are fighting extradition to Florida harder than your auntie fights for the last piece of black cake at Christmas.
