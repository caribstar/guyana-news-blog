# 👴🏾 UNCLE RAMESH'S HOT TAKE

**Wednesday, January 28, 2026**

*From Queens, NY — Where we read ALL the papers, not just the headlines!*

---

Ayyy, family! Uncle Ramesh here, and me cyah believe wha me reading from The Brief today!

Budget 2026 drop — THE BIGGEST BUDGET IN GUYANA HISTORY — and The Brief still finding ways to throw shade! Let Uncle Ramesh set the record straight.

---

## 💰 THE $100,000 CASH GRANT: THIS IS HISTORIC!

The Brief says: "Opposition says it's skewed allocation of resources."

**Uncle Ramesh says:** SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS going directly into Guyanese pockets! 

Let me break this down for the slow learners at The Brief:

- Every adult 18 and over getting $100,000
- That's DIRECT CASH TRANSFER
- No middleman, no "family and friends"
- STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE

When last any government put $60 billion directly in citizens' hands? I'll wait.

And it's not just the cash grant! Because We Care up to $60,000. Transportation grant for children. Pension increase. Public assistance increase. Community workers getting $50,000 monthly now!

**The Brief wants to call this "skewed"?** Skewed towards WHO? THE PEOPLE?!

---

## 🏠 15,000 HOUSE LOTS AND 8,000 HOMES

The Brief says: "Whether that means better planning or just more promises remains to be seen."

**Uncle Ramesh says:** What "remains to be seen"?! 

In 5 years, this government built more houses than any government in Guyana history! They distributed more house lots than any government EVER!

And now they promising even MORE — with focus OUTSIDE Region Four!

The people in Berbice getting house lots. The people in Essequibo getting house lots. This is NATIONAL development, not Georgetown-only development.

But sure, The Brief gon sit there and say "remains to be seen." 

Me done see it! Me family in Berbice LIVING in the new houses!

---

## ✈️ TOURISM BOOM: 453,489 VISITORS!

The Brief says: "Let's hope the tourists actually come. Otherwise, we'll have very nice empty buildings."

**Uncle Ramesh says:** The tourists ARE coming! 453,489 of them! That's a RECORD!

- 9 international hotels in 5 years
- Air Transat flying from Toronto
- American Airlines, JetBlue, Copa — all expanding routes
- Destination of the Year award!

The Brief want to act like the hotels might be empty? The hotels FULL! You cyah even book room during cricket season!

This is INVESTMENT CONFIDENCE. Private sector putting THEIR money because THEY see the future. But The Brief gon play skeptic from their keyboard.

---

## 🎓 FIRST SCHOOL FOR AUTISTIC STUDENTS

Here's something The Brief barely mentioned: Guyana building its FIRST school for autistic students!

$316.5 million for special needs education and services. This government building facilities for EVERY Guyanese, including those with disabilities.

Day care facilities expanding. Support systems being built. Families with special needs children finally getting resources!

But sure, let's talk more about the Opposition Leader drama.

---

## 🗳️ ABOUT THE OPPOSITION LEADER...

Now, The Brief want to make big jokes about Azruddin Mohamed becoming Opposition Leader.

**Let Uncle Ramesh ask a serious question:** This is the best the Opposition could find?

A man under US sanctions? A man facing extradition? A man whose businesses shut down? THIS is who the PNC and WIN voters chose to represent them?

The Brief calling it "irony." Uncle Ramesh calling it SELF-DESTRUCTION.

The government had NOTHING to do with this election. Article 184 clear — it's the Opposition's business. And they chose to make an indicted man their leader.

When he get extradite — and he WILL get extradite — what the Opposition gon do then? Start over?

This isn't funny. This is SAD for Guyana's democracy. We NEED a functioning opposition. Instead, we getting circus.

---

## 📊 THE REAL SCORECARD

| What Government Doing | What Opposition Doing |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| $100K to every adult | Electing indicted leader |
| 15,000 house lots | Visiting construction sites to complain |
| Record tourism | No economic plan |
| Autism school | No social policy |
| Development Bank | No alternative budget |

See the difference?

## 🇬🇾 UNCLE RAMESH'S VERDICT

Budget 2026 is TRANSFORMATIONAL. Direct cash transfers, housing expansion, tourism boom, special needs services, zero-interest loans for entrepreneurs...

This is a government WORKING.

The Opposition response? Elect a man wanted by America as their leader, then visit a school site and say it "not ready."

The Brief can crack all the jokes they want. But the FACTS speak for themselves.

Guyana moving forward. The only question is whether the Opposition will get out of the way or get run over.
