Activities include:
- Sharing audiobook recommendations for the 45-minute wait
- Rating which lane moves fastest (spoiler: none of them)

## &#128172; POLITICAL MUSICAL CHAIRS

Word on the street is that certain opposition figures have been practicing their "congratulations" speeches - the kind you give when you don't mean it.

Meanwhile, other opposition figures have allegedly been practicing their "I told you so" speeches for approximately six months from now.

The designer insists it's "innovation."

The band members insist it's "budget cuts with extra steps."

## &#128172; DIPLOMATIC DINNER DISASTER

A certain embassy reportedly held a dinner last week where the main course arrived late because - you guessed it - the delivery truck got stuck in Eccles traffic.

By the time the food arrived, the appetizers had been so thoroughly consumed that one diplomat allegedly asked if "the bread basket counts as the main course in Guyanese culture."

It does not. But everyone was too polite to say so.

A Stabroek Market vendor, when asked about the Opposition Leader situation:

"I don't follow politics. I follow money. When somebody come to my stall, I don't ask who they vote for. I ask what they buying."

*Pause*

"But if you ask me personally? All ah dem need to sit down and talk. This country too small for all this drama."

She then sold three pounds of tomatoes and moved on with her day.
