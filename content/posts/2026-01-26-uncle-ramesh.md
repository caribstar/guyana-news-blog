## 💰 BUDGET 2026: DIS IS WHAT GOOD GOVERNANCE LOOK LIKE!

Let me tell allyuh something. When de PPP/C say they gon do something, THEY DO IT!

President Ali PROMISE in de campaign:
- ✅ $100,000 cash grant to every adult
- ✅ Zero-interest loans for small businesses
- ✅ Income tax threshold going up
- ✅ Net property tax ABOLISHED

And today, Finance Minister Singh gon DELIVER! 

You know how many countries in de world giving $100,000 to every adult citizen? NOT MANY! But Guyana doing it because WE HAVE DE RESOURCES and WE HAVE GOOD MANAGEMENT!

Me nephew Rakesh text me: "Uncle, when de money coming?"

I tell he: "Boy, have patience! De budget just now presenting! But it COMING!"

## 🤡 DE OPPOSITION: MAKING GUYANA LOOK BAD

Now, let me address dis Opposition Leader nonsense.

De Brief trying to make it seem like de government blocking de election. FALSE! De government have NOTHING to do with who de opposition elect! Dat is THEIR business!

But here is de REAL story de Brief won't tell you:

**De opposition CHOOSE to elect a man who is:**
- Sanctioned by de United States
- Facing extradition to Florida
- Accused of smuggling 10,000 KILOGRAMS of gold
- Accused of evading $50 MILLION in taxes

And dey wondering why de international community concerned? DEM IS DE ONES EMBARRASSING GUYANA!

**Dr. Leslie Ramsammy** say it perfect: Singapore just REMOVE dey Opposition Leader fuh lying under oath. We about to INSTALL one who facing international criminal charges!

## 📋 What Uncle Ramesh Reading in de Papers Today

From de **Guyana Chronicle**:
- Budget 2026 will reflect "policy, consistency, clarity and continuity"
- **Palmyra Stadium** nearly complete — Berbice getting WORLD CLASS infrastructure!
- **Four Points by Sheraton** opening soon — MORE hotels, MORE tourism, MORE jobs!
- **Chinese medical team** opening specialized clinic fuh metabolic diseases

From me own research:
- The 2025 budget was $1.382 TRILLION
- Capital spending NOW over 50% of budget (was less than 25% in 2019)
- Government investing in LONG-TERM development, not short-term handouts

## 🏗️ DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING EVERYWHERE

While de opposition busy fighting over who gon be de "fugitive leader," look wha de government doing:

| Project | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Palmyra Stadium | Nearly Complete |
| Four Points by Sheraton | Opening Shortly |
| Gas-to-Energy | On track for late 2026 |
| Wales Industrial Estate | Under Development |
| New Housing Schemes | Expanding Nationwide |

**Devendra Bishoo** — former WEST INDIES PLAYER — say de stadium is "a game-changer for young people."

But de Daily Brief want to focus on de opposition drama. TYPICAL!
