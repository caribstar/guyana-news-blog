**[AVATAR ON SCREEN]**

"Wha gwan everybody! Here's your 60-second Guyana news roundup!

Budget 2026 dropping Monday! You KNOW Finance Minister gon say 'largest budget in history.' They say that every year. At this point, it's not news, it's tradition!

[Quick transition]

Meanwhile, Azruddin Mohamed apparently 'scared' about the vote. Maybe he should be more scared about that US indictment, but who am I to judge?

[Quick transition]

Barama just dropped ONE BILLION dollars on plywood production. Waterproof plywood! With how much Guyana flooding, that's actually genius business right there!

[Quick transition]

And INTERPOL bust a gold smuggling ring in Guyana. In GUYANA. Where gold dealers running for Opposition Leader. Completely unrelated, I'm sure!

**[INTRO — 0:00-0:20]**

**[TITLE CARD: THE GUYANA BRIEF]**
**[SUBTITLE: Saturday, January 24, 2026]**

**[AVATAR ON SCREEN]**

"Good morning everyone, and welcome to The Guyana Brief! I'm your host, and this is your Saturday news roundup — covering all four Guyanese newspapers so you don't have to!

Grab your coffee, grab your roti, and let's get into it!"

**[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET & OPPOSITION LEADER — 0:20-1:30]**

**[GRAPHIC: BUDGET 2026 / OPPOSITION LEADER VOTE]**

"Alright, Monday is going to be a BIG day in Guyana. Two major events happening.

First — Budget 2026 presentation. Now, I'm not going to make any predictions, but... [leans in] it's going to be the 'largest budget in Guyana's history.' 

I know, I know — they say that EVERY year. But this year APNU actually raising some concerns. They saying with oil prices dropping, maybe government shouldn't be borrowing so much. Quote: 'Another largest budget would be a reckless gamble.'

Now, APNU giving fiscal advice is a little bit like... well... let's just say they didn't exactly leave the treasury overflowing when they left office. But fair point about oil prices — that's real.

[Transition]

Second big Monday event — the Opposition Leader vote! 

After MONTHS of drama, we're finally getting a vote on who will be Leader of the Opposition. Azruddin Mohamed from WIN party is the frontrunner, but here's where it gets interesting...

APNU says they're going to ABSTAIN. Not vote against him, not vote for him — just... not vote. They have 12 seats! And they're choosing to sit this one out!

Kaieteur News reporting that Mohamed himself is 'scared' ahead of the vote. Scared of what, exactly? The vote? The responsibility? The US extradition case that's still pending? 

The Western diplomats apparently had an 'interesting' meeting with Speaker Nadir about all this. When diplomats call something 'interesting,' you KNOW there's drama behind closed doors."

**[SEGMENT 2: DEVELOPMENT NEWS — 1:30-2:20]**

**[GRAPHIC: DEVELOPMENT ROUNDUP]**

"Let's talk about some actual development news!

Barama Company just invested ONE BILLION dollars to boost their plywood production. And they're introducing waterproof plywood!

Now, some people might laugh at plywood news, but think about it — Guyana floods every rainy season. Waterproof plywood? That's not just smart business, that's survival gear!

[Transition]

President Ali launched a shade house project in Georgetown. He called it 'game-changing.'

Look — when you hear 'game-changing' you might expect something massive. And yes, it's basically fancy gardening. BUT... if it means cheaper vegetables, I'm here for it. Tomatoes costing more than steak these days.

[Transition]

Minister Edghill finally snapped about all the abandoned vehicles blocking roads everywhere. Quote: 'TOTAL DISRESPECT NOW!'

Every neighborhood in Guyana has that one car sitting on blocks since the Hoyte administration. The bush growing through the windshield, chickens living in the backseat. Edghill says REMOVE THEM. 

Watch how many people suddenly find their car registration papers now!"

---

**[SEGMENT 3: INTERNATIONAL & CRIME — 2:20-3:10]**

**[GRAPHIC: INTERNATIONAL NEWS]**

"Quick international hits!

Venezuela's interim government is overhauling their oil laws. Guyana watching closely, because whatever Venezuela does with oil affects what WE can negotiate. Or... you know... what Exxon tells us we can negotiate.

Trump still trying to acquire Greenland. The man collecting territories like Pokémon cards! At this rate, he might come for Essequibo before Venezuela does!

[Transition]

And in crime news — INTERPOL busted a gold smuggling ring right here in Guyana.

Gold smuggling. In GUYANA. The country where gold is literally everywhere. The country where gold dealers are running for Opposition Leader.

I am absolutely SHOCKED. Shocked, I tell you! Who could have predicted that people would try to illegally profit from gold in a gold-rich country?!"

---

**[SEGMENT 4: SPORTS & CLOSING — 3:10-4:00]**

**[GRAPHIC: SPORTS]**

"Quick sports update — Guyana women's cricket team beat Jamaica in the CWI Blaze T20 Championships! Skipper Shemaine Campbelle scored an unbeaten 50. Big up to the ladies!

West Indies preparing for their Afghanistan T20 series in Dubai ahead of the T20 World Cup. Let's hope they show up and show OUT!

[CLOSING]

**[AVATAR FULL SCREEN]**

Alright people, that's your Saturday Brief!

To recap:
- Budget Monday — prepare for 'largest ever' 
- Opposition Leader vote Monday — prepare for drama
- Barama dropping billions — prepare for waterproof plywood

**[TITLE CARD: CARIBBEAN DAILY BRIEF — Jan 24, 2026]**

**[AVATAR ON SCREEN]**

"Caribbean news in 60 seconds — let's GO!

Jamaica secured $415 million from the IMF. When the IMF is your financial advisor, you know times hard!

Caribbean nationals facing stricter US visa rules. Birth tourism crackdown, they calling it. So pregnant women can't visit Disney World anymore without an interrogation!

Trinidad and the US are best friends now, apparently. Trump administration and Kamla government holding hands across the Caribbean Sea. Politics strange, eh?

Barbados FM watching US military strikes in our waters and asking about 'due process.' The Americans patrolling the Caribbean like it's their swimming pool!

Venezuela changing their oil laws under new management. Every Caribbean nation taking notes!

And Guyana's Budget 2026 dropping Monday — at this rate, Guyana's budget going to be bigger than some Caribbean countries' entire GDP!
