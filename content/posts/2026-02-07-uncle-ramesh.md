And this is ONE of FIVE stadiums opening in 2026!

| What Linden Had | What Linden Getting |

| No concerts | Samuel Medas AND Diana Chapman! |

The government aiming for INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATION within two years! World-class athletes competing in LINDEN! Can you IMAGINE?

## ⛏️ PRESIDENT ALI IN THE BUSH — TALKING TO REAL PEOPLE

*Sources: Guyana Chronicle, Guyana Times*

While politicians sitting in air-conditioned Parliament talking about what miners NEED, President Ali actually GO to Puruni and Bartica and ASK THEM!

And he didn't come with empty words. He came with a PLAN:

✅ Land allocations for small miners' consortiums within TWO MONTHS
✅ Banks going DIRECTLY to mining communities — open accounts ON SITE
✅ Duty REMOVED on ATVs — price dropping from $3.5M to under $2M!
✅ Duty on 4-door pickups reduced — SAVING $7-10 MILLION per vehicle!
✅ Community policing groups for miner safety
✅ Government teams deploying within 3-4 weeks to regularise operations

Gold declarations already UP — 484,321 ounces in 2025, up from 434,067 in 2024! Target for 2026: 510,450 ounces!

**Uncle Ramesh Say:** THIS is leadership! Not sitting in Parliament making speeches — actually GOING to the people and DELIVERING solutions! The Brief calling it "promises" — Uncle Ramesh calling it a DETAILED ACTION PLAN with TIMELINES!

## 🎤 ABOUT THE OPPOSITION LEADER'S "MAIDEN SPEECH"...

Look, Uncle Ramesh try to listen with an open mind. Uncle Ramesh REALLY try.

But when a man under US sanctions, facing extradition proceedings, standing up in Parliament talking about "transparency and accountability"... you have to LAUGH!

| What Mohamed Said | What Uncle Ramesh Heard |
|---|---|
| "70,000 public servants got nothing" | Forgetting cash grants, housing, infrastructure |
| "Budget masks weak oversight" | Said the man the US wants for gold smuggling |
| "Women can't afford children" | Birth rate is a GLOBAL trend, not budget issue |
| "Fishing industry in decline" | Oil sector creating TEN TIMES more value |

The man said "109,000 voters chose hope over fear." Uncle Ramesh say 217,000+ voters chose the PPP! MATHEMATICS!

## ⚡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: MOVING FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS

*Source: Guyana Chronicle*

The Brief trying to make it sound like a problem that Phase Two bidding is happening while Phase One is under construction. That's called PLANNING! That's called EFFICIENCY!

Phase One: All four gas turbines ON foundations! Six transformers placed! 3,000+ cubic metres concrete poured! Simple-cycle power by end of 2026!

Phase Two: Five contractors shortlisted! Bids due March 31!

**Uncle Ramesh Say:** If they WAITED until Phase One was completely finished before even STARTING Phase Two planning, The Brief would say the government "has no vision." You can't win with these people!

---

## ⚖️ ICJ HEARINGS — UNITED WE STAND

*Source: All Papers*

AG Nandlall announced oral hearings start May 4, 2026. This is the DEFINING issue of our generation. Venezuela claiming two-thirds of OUR country!

Uncle Ramesh agrees with The Brief on this one (don't faint!): EVERY Guyanese must pay attention. And Uncle Ramesh is PROUD of the legal team the government has assembled.

---

## 🏏 WINDIES TIME! COME ON, BOYS!

West Indies vs Scotland TODAY at Eden Gardens! Shai Hope leading the charge! Daren Sammy coaching! 5:30am Guyana time!

Uncle Ramesh already set he alarm. He already wearing he jersey. He nephew in Brooklyn already got the projector set up.

**IF WE WIN:** Is because of the Caribbean spirit!
**IF WE LOSE:** Uncle Ramesh will be back next week pretending this game never happened.

## 📰 WHAT THE BRIEF MISSED (As Usual)

**Saipem Wins ExxonMobil Local Impact Award** — A GLOBAL engineering company being recognised for building LOCAL capacity and training LOCAL people! This is what the oil sector partnership looks like!

**AGM Inc. Introduces PAID Paternity Leave** — A mining company giving fathers paid time off for newborns! Private sector RAISING STANDARDS because the economy is STRONG!

**Gail Teixeira Defends Government Record** — Minister of Parliamentary Affairs dismissed the opposition's "narrow assessment" of poverty and growth indicators. Budget 2026 is TRANSFORMATIONAL!

**Peter Ramsaroop's Maiden Budget Speech** — The Chief Investment Officer said the President "designed an economy that my kids and your kids can raise this flag and be proud of." WELL SAID!

**Elite League Cup Starting Feb 14** — Football federation launching a BRAND NEW competition! Nine teams! Sports infrastructure growing!
