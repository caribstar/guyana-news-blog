## 🛣️ LINDEN TO MABURA HILL ROAD: 62% COMPLETE

**Project:** Linden to Mabura Hill Road Upgrade  
**Contractor:** Alya Construtora (Brazil)  
**Cost:** US$190 million  
**Status:** 62% complete ✅

Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill provided this update following a January 7 meeting with the Brazilian contractors.

**What it means:** The critical road connecting Linden to the interior is progressing steadily. Once complete, this will significantly improve access to mining areas and interior communities.

**What to watch:** Weather delays and whether the 2026 completion target holds.

## ⛽ GAS-TO-ENERGY: MAIN PROJECT ON TRACK, SIDE PROJECTS DELAYED

**Main Gas-to-Energy Project (Wales)**
- **Status:** "Steadily progressing" and "firmly on track"
- **Target:** End of 2026

**Gas Bottling Company (GBBL)**
- **Original Deadline:** January 15, 2026
- **New Deadline:** February 19, 2026 ⚠️

**Ammonia & Urea Plant (GAUP)**
- **Original Deadline:** January 22, 2026
- **New Deadline:** March 5, 2026 ⚠️

Prime Minister Mark Phillips says the deadline extensions are NOT due to lack of interest — companies have submitted requests and meetings are scheduled.

**Translation:** They got interest but need more time to evaluate. Whether that's good project management or scope creep, time will tell.

## 🏟️ BAYROCK STADIUM: OPENING JANUARY 31!

**Project:** Bayrock Track and Field Stadium (Wismar, Linden)  
**Location:** Region 10 (Upper Demerara-Berbice)  
**Status:** Opening January 31, 2026 ✅

After years of waiting, Linden is FINALLY getting its proper track and field facility!

This is a big win for sports development in Region 10, which has produced numerous national athletes but lacked proper training infrastructure.

**Mark your calendars:** Official opening is January 31.

## 🚢 PORT DEVELOPMENT: BELGIAN INTEREST

**Project:** Maritime port development/modernization

## 🎯 THE TAKEAWAY

**Good news:** Major infrastructure projects are moving. The Linden-Mabura road is past the halfway mark, the stadium is about to open, and international partners are interested in ports and airports.

**Concerns:** The gas-related side projects (bottling and urea) are already seeing deadline slippage. These extensions aren't dramatic, but they're worth watching.

**The pattern:** The government is better at big flagship projects than the supporting infrastructure around them. Let's see if that changes.

*Next week: We check on the housing developments and the New Demerara River Crossing.*
