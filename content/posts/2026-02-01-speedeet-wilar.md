## 🪶 De Plan

**Speedeet:** Yeah, but dem costume cost like fifty thousand dollars. We got fifty CENTS between us.

**Wilar:** Dat is why we improvise. Listen — Miss Sharma next door got a whole clothesline full of bright colour clothes. She got feathers from she pillow that burst last week. And me grandmother got glitter from Christmas that she hiding in a tin.

**Speedeet:** *(suspicious)* Yuh want we to TIEF Miss Sharma feathers?

**Wilar:** NOT tief! BORROW. We guh ask she nice nice.

**Wilar:** Dat is because yuh didn't ASK — yuh was already in de tree when she come outside!

**Speedeet:** Details, details.

## 🏆 De Decision

**Speedeet:** YA THINK?!

**Wilar:** We could just go watch de parade instead. Stand on de side. Eat doubles. Drink juice.

**Speedeet:** NOW yuh talking sense. Dat was de plan from de start.

**Wilar:** But we would have looked AMAZING.

**Speedeet:** We would have looked like de before picture in a "what not to wear" poster.

**Wilar:** *(grinning)* At least we tried.

**Speedeet:** *(touching he head)* Me head STILL sticky from de glue.

**Wilar:** Coconut oil. Me grandmother swear by it.

**Speedeet:** Yuh grandmother got solution fuh everything EXCEPT how to keep she grandson out of trouble.

**Wilar:** True. Me she biggest project.
