## 🏆 THIS WEEK'S HALL OF FAME

---

### 🥇 FIRST PLACE: De Solar Panel Goat Shelter

**Location:** Somewhere in Region Nine  
**Spotted by:** A very confused government inspector

You know dem 37,000 solar panels de government distributing to hinterland communities? Beautiful initiative. Clean energy. Progress.

Well, ONE family decide de solar panel was TOO NICE to put on de roof. So dey put it on de GROUND. As a GOAT SHELTER.

De goats living GOOD under dat $50,000 solar panel while de family still using kerosene lamp inside.

When asked about it, de homeowner reportedly said: "De goat dem does get too hot in de sun. Now dey comfortable."

**Can't even be mad. De goats DO look comfortable.**

🐐☀️ *Rating: 10/10 for goat welfare, 0/10 for energy efficiency*

### 🥈 SECOND PLACE: De Three-Lane Parker

**Location:** Bourda Market  
**Vehicle:** White Canter truck

Dis man park he truck across THREE parking spaces AND half de road. When de traffic warden approach, he say: "Me just stopping quick quick."

"Quick quick" turned into TWO HOURS while he buy provisions, eat doubles, lime with he friend, and make three phone calls.

Traffic backed up to Camp Street. De warden write FOUR tickets. De man tear up all four and drive off.

Bourda Market: Where parking rules are just SUGGESTIONS.

🚛 *Rating: Legendary audacity*

### 🥉 THIRD PLACE: De Minibus Aquarium

**Location:** Route 42, Regent Street  
**Spotted during:** Friday flooding

Flooding on Regent Street ankle-deep. Most vehicles going slow slow, testing de water.

Not Route 42 bus #GT 5892. 

Dis man ACCELERATE through de flood like he auditioning for Fast & Furious: Georgetown Drift. Water SPLASH through de windows. Passengers SCREAMING. Fish from de nearby trench somehow END UP INSIDE DE BUS.

One passenger reportedly catch a small hassar and take it home fuh cook-up.

When asked why he speed through flood water, de driver say: "Time is money. Dem passengers had places to be."

🐟🚐 *Rating: Innovative seafood delivery*

### De Creative Road Sign

Someone in Agricola put up dey own road sign:

**"CAUTION: POTHOLE AHEAD"**  
**"AND BEHIND"**  
**"AND TO DE LEFT"**  
**"ACTUALLY, JUST CAUTION EVERYWHERE"**

De sign more accurate than anything M&CC ever put up.

### De Cow in de ATM Line

**Location:** Republic Bank, Vreed-en-Hoop

A cow. In de ATM line. Standing patiently behind two humans.

Nobody questioned it. De cow waited its turn. When it reached de machine, it just... stood there. Then walked away.

We don't know what de cow was trying to accomplish. Maybe checking its balance. Maybe frustrated with de service fees like de rest of we.

🐄💳

### De Double-Decker Bicycle

**Location:** East Coast Highway

One man. One bicycle. Carrying:
- A fridge (strapped to de back)
- Two car tires (around his neck)
- A chicken (in a basket on de handlebars)
- What appeared to be a small generator (balanced on he head)

Moving at FULL SPEED down de highway.

No helmet. No lights. Just vibes and determination.

🚴‍♂️ *This is peak Guyanese engineering*

## FINAL THOUGHT

Guyana is a place where de absurd is normal and de normal is boring. We embrace it. We laugh at it. And most importantly, we DOCUMENT it fuh de world to see.

Because somewhere out deh RIGHT NOW, somebody doing something dat would break de internet in any other country, but here? Here we just say "Eh, that normal" and keep moving.

Never change, Guyana. Never change.
