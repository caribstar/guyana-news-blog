## 🎯 Finally! Winston Jordan Admits APNU+AFC Messed Up

Eh eh! So now Winston Jordan, the **former APNU+AFC Finance Minister**, finally come out and admit what we been saying all along - **THEY signed a bad deal with Exxon!**

Not PPP. Not Jagdeo. Not Ali. **THEM.**

Jordan himself say Guyana was "exploited" and they signed away 600 blocks instead of 60. He blaming Venezuela pressure and failing industries, but lemme tell you something - that's called **making excuses for incompetence.**

You know what a competent government woulda do? Get proper legal advice. Hire oil experts. Negotiate harder. But no, they sign anything Exxon put in front of them because they was desperate.

And now these same people want to criticize the PPP for not renegotiating? **Bai, you sign the contract!** You think Exxon gon tear it up because we ask nice?

The PPP doing what it can - maximizing local content, building infrastructure with the revenue, creating jobs. **That's how you work with a bad hand you didn't deal yourself.**

## 🛡️ Border Security: This Is What Real Leadership Looks Like

PM Phillips announce troops on "heightened readiness" at the borders after the Venezuela situation. **This is exactly what we need** - calm, professional, prepared.

No panic. No inflammatory statements. No chest-beating. Just **quiet competence.**

The PM personally went to Region One to assess the situation. He met with defence officials, regional authorities, and residents. That's a leader who takes security seriously but doesn't create hysteria.

Compare this to how the APNU+AFC handled anything - remember the chaos? The contradictions? The confusion?

**This government moves different.** Professional. Strategic. Ready for anything but not looking for trouble.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Moving: Moleson Creek Road Opening Up Berbice

While the opposition busy complaining, the government busy **building.**

The Moleson Creek to Eldorado Road project connecting Crabwood Creek to Orealla to Kwakwani? **That's transformation.** Thousands of acres of farmland opening up. Farmers getting market access. Remote communities connected.

Minister Ramraj said it best: "This road is opening farm-to-market access and unlocking thousands of acres of land for farmers."

**That's development.** Not talk. Not promises. Actual construction happening right now.

And yes, some school projects in Region Nine moving slower than planned. You know what? **Hinterland construction is hard.** Getting materials there, weather challenges, logistics. The opposition MP Duncan want to score political points, but the projects still progressing. They'll get done.

## 🗳️ Opposition Leader Drama: They Can't Even Organize Themselves

Lincoln Lewis and the letter writers demanding the Opposition Leader election. **But wait** - isn't this an opposition problem?

The opposition parties can't even agree among themselves who should lead. WIN, APNU, AFC - they all fighting like crabs in a barrel. And they want blame the government?

**Article 184 is clear** - the non-government members elect the Opposition Leader. The Speaker chairs it. But the opposition members have to **actually agree** on a candidate first!

Instead of writing letters to newspapers, maybe they should have a meeting? Just a thought.

Meanwhile, the government busy governing. Budget consultations happening with the Private Sector Commission, Georgetown Chamber of Commerce, and business groups nationwide. **Work continues whether opposition shows up or not.**

## 🎉 Republic Day Coming: 56 Years of Sovereignty

Next month marks **56 years since Guyana became a Republic.** Mashramani season approaching!

This is what we should be celebrating - our independence, our sovereignty, our progress. Look how far we've come since 1970. An oil-producing nation. Growing economy. International respect.

Yes, we have challenges. Every country does. But we also have achievements worth celebrating.

The government committed to inclusive development, marginalised groups getting support, schools for children with disabilities opening (like the Yas School of Inspiration), solar farms commissioning in Region Two.

**Progress is happening.** You just have to open your eyes to see it.

## 🇬🇾 Uncle Ramesh's Monday Message

Listen, today a former APNU+AFC minister admitted on live broadcast that his government got exploited by Exxon. **On live broadcast.** 

That's not PPP propaganda. That's not Kaieteur spin. That's **their own man** saying what happened.

So the next time somebody try tell you the PPP responsible for the oil contract, you remind them: Winston Jordan just told you the truth. Finally.

Now the PPP working with what they inherited - building roads, securing borders, developing the country. **That's what good governance looks like.**

Is Monday. The week just starting. The government working. 

And somewhere in Berbice, a road crew connecting farmers to markets. 

**Progress, baby. Progress.** 🇬🇾
