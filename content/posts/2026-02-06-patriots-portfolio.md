💰 **PATRIOTS PORTFOLIO** 💰
*Your Weekly Guide to Building Wealth in the World's Fastest-Growing Economy*

Happy Friday, Patriots! This week was ALL about Budget 2026 — four days of parliamentary debate, a trillion-dollar-plus spending plan, and more opinions about your money than a rum shop on a Saturday night. Let's break down what matters for YOUR wallet.

## 📊 THE BIG PICTURE: $1.588 TRILLION BUDGET

Budget 2026 is the largest in Guyana's history. Again. Every year we say "record budget" and every year it gets bigger. But size isn't everything — what matters is where the money goes and whether ordinary Guyanese feel it.

**Key allocations that affect you:**
- **$60 billion** for $100,000 cash grants (600,000 adults)
- **$183.6 billion** for education sector
- **$14.5 billion** for UG (tuition-free since 2025)
- **$5.8 billion** for GOAL scholarships
- **$7.5 billion** housing improvement subsidy
- **$6 billion** for sports development
- **$10.7 billion** for Gas-to-Energy project
- **Pension raised** to $46,000/month with transport grant
- **Low-income mortgage ceiling** increased
- **Zero excise tax** on fuel maintained
- **VAT reduced** on vehicles

## 🏠 HOUSING: THE WEALTH-BUILDING OPPORTUNITY

The increased low-income mortgage ceiling and the $7.5 billion housing improvement subsidy are potentially the most important wealth-building measures in the budget. Here's why:

Home ownership is the foundation of generational wealth. When you own a home, you have collateral. Collateral means you can borrow to start a business, invest, or expand. Renting traps you in a cycle where your money goes to someone else's wealth.

**Patriot's Move:** If you qualify for the housing subsidy or the expanded mortgage, DO NOT sleep on this. Get your documents in order NOW. Visit the Central Housing & Planning Authority. The Success Housing Scheme on the East Coast is delivering house lots — position yourself.

## ✈️ TOURISM: 17.2% GROWTH = BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

January 2026: 34,923 visitors, up 17.2% from last year. Full year projection: 550,000 arrivals. This sector is GROWING and creating real opportunities for small business owners.

**Where the money is:**
- **Eco-tourism:** Guyana's brand is the rainforest. Nature guides, lodges, adventure tourism
- **Destination weddings:** Government just removed residency requirements. Wedding planners, caterers, photographers — your market just expanded
- **Transport services:** 38% of visitors are from the US. They need reliable ground transport
- **Food and hospitality:** Every tourist eats three meals a day. That's 104,769 meals in January alone

**Patriot's Move:** If you have skills in hospitality, transport, or event planning, NOW is the time to formalize your business. Get that business registration, GRA compliance, and NIS compliance. The barriers to government contracts are real (as Stabroek's letter writer pointed out this week), but the tourism private sector is wide open.

## ⛏️ GOLD: THE OTHER WEALTH ENGINE

President Ali's visit to miners in Region 7 today and the crackdown on illegal mining signal that the government is serious about getting more value from gold. Key facts:

- Gold declarations up 10.9% in 2025, but government says it's not enough
- 53 illegal miners arrested and convicted in January alone
- Brazilian miners with low or no declarations being targeted
- Aris Mining advancing the Toroparu project (5.3 million ounces)
- Omai Gold Mines targeting a "transformational 2026"

**What this means for investors:** The gold sector is being cleaned up and professionalized. Legal, compliant operations will benefit as illegal operators are pushed out. If you have mining interests, DECLARE EVERYTHING — the government is deregistering dredges with no declarations.

## 📉 THE POVERTY DEBATE: WHAT THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY SAY

The IDB study showing 58% overall poverty rate has dominated the debate. But context matters:

1. The data is from 2021 — peak COVID, when incomes collapsed globally
2. The World Bank uses multi-dimensional poverty, which showed 6.5% vulnerability in 2019 (pre-pandemic)
3. Unemployment dropped from 12.8% to 6.8% between 2020 and 2024
4. 104,000 jobs created in four years
5. Venezuelan migrant workers (28,000 by 2021) are disproportionately in informal sectors with very low wages

**The honest take:** Guyana's economy is growing faster than almost anywhere on earth. But growth hasn't reached everyone equally. The cash grants, housing subsidies, and education investments are meant to bridge that gap. Whether they're enough is a legitimate debate — but pretending nothing is happening is dishonest.

## 💡 PATRIOT'S WEEKLY INVESTMENT TIPS

### For the SMALL SAVER ($50,000-$500,000):
- **Open a savings account** if you don't have one. The banking sector is expanding — GBTI just launched private banking, but regular services are also improving
- **Apply for GOAL scholarship** — $5.8 billion allocated, 10,805 awarded last year. Free education = higher earning power
- **Use the cash grant wisely** — $100,000 can be seed capital for a small business, not just consumption

### For the GROWING INVESTOR ($500,000-$5,000,000):
- **Housing** — The expanded mortgage ceiling means you can buy more house for less down payment. Property values near development corridors (East Bank, East Coast) are rising
- **Small business** — Tourism-adjacent services have the most immediate opportunity
- **Agriculture** — Government pushing science-driven, climate-smart farming. Agri-processing has export potential

### For the SERIOUS INVESTOR ($5M+):
- **Gold sector** — Legal, compliant operations positioned to benefit from sector cleanup
- **Real estate** — Hotel boom continues, but commercial property near new infrastructure is the smart play
- **Technology** — Caribbean Tech Alliance linking Guyana and Jamaica. Digital services sector emerging

## 📌 BOTTOM LINE

Budget 2026 is the biggest ever. The opposition says it has "nothing for the people." The government says it's "transformational." The truth, as usual, is somewhere in the middle. The ALLOCATIONS are there — cash grants, housing, education, healthcare. The QUESTION is whether the money reaches the right people efficiently and whether the economic growth translates into opportunities you can actually access.

Your job as a Patriot is not to wait for the government OR the opposition to build your wealth. Use every programme, every grant, every opportunity available. Get your documents in order. Formalize your hustle. Invest in education. And keep reading the Portfolio.

Until next Friday — build wealth, not arguments! 🇬🇾💪
