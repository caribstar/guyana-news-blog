## 🏠 HOUSING: 15,000 Lots, 8,000 Homes, Infinite Dreams

The housing programme getting a **$159.1 billion** injection. The government plans to:

- Continue reducing the backlog outside Region Four

**Dr. Singh:** "Our investments in housing are not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride."

**Reality Check:** Lot distribution faster than actual house construction. But at least you can camp on your land and look at the stars while you wait for building materials prices to drop.
