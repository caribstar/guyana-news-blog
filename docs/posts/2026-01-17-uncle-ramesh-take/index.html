government\u0026rsquo;s swift response to security issues, and a reminder that our women cricketers are STILL defending champions!","keywords":["Uncle Ramesh","Pro-Government","Diaspora Voice","Commentary"],"articleBody":"Uncle Ramesh’s Response from Queens, NY — Saturday, January 17, 2026\nEh eh! The Daily Brief wake up this morning and choose negativity AGAIN! Every single day is the same thing — government build something, they complain. Government fix something, they complain. Government breathe, they complain!\nBut me ain’t going let them bring down the good vibes on this beautiful Saturday. Let Uncle Ramesh set the record straight for the diaspora who want FACTS, not fiction!\n☀️ SOLAR FARM SUCCESS — BUT BRIEF STILL FINDING PROBLEMS! The government just commissioned a US$8.14 MILLION solar farm at Charity that will benefit over 3,500 households, save GY$267 million per year in fuel costs, and offset 3,500 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually.\nThis is FIFTH solar farm under the GUYSOL programme! FIFTH! In less than three months!\nTotal investment: US$83.3 MILLION in renewable energy!\nAnd what the Daily Brief have to say? “BUT BUT BUT blackouts still happening!”\nYuh see how these people does operate? The government literally building the solution, step by step, systematically bringing renewable energy online, and them still finding something negative to say.\nLet Me Break It Down For You:\nWhat Government Doing What Brief Ignoring 18 MWp solar capacity now online This takes TIME to build 33 MWp total coming by end of programme Rome wasn’t built in a day Gas-to-Energy project progressing 300 MW coming end of 2026 Amaila Falls Hydro still on agenda Long-term vision, people! By end of 2026, Guyana will have 300 megawatts from gas plus all this solar capacity. But them want miracle overnight? Building energy infrastructure for a developing nation takes YEARS of planning and execution!\nThe PPP/C government doing what no other government did — actually INVESTING in energy solutions instead of just talking!\n🔫 SECURITY ISSUE? GOVERNMENT AND POLICE ACTING SWIFTLY! Now, about this security company with the airsoft guns — yes, it’s a problem. Nobody disputing that.\nBUT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED:\n✅ Police conducted intelligence-led operation ✅ Arrests were made immediately ✅ Owner of company in custody ✅ Investigation ongoing ✅ Public informed promptly\nThis is how a functioning government works! When problems arise, you ADDRESS them! You investigate, you arrest, you prosecute!\nThe Daily Brief making it sound like government responsible for what private companies do behind closed doors. Should President Ali personally inspect every security guard holster? Should Brigadier Phillips stand outside every supermarket checking firearms?\nThe police did their job. The system worked. Criminals got caught.\nNEXT!\n🏦 PRIVATE BANKING — ECONOMIC SOPHISTICATION! Oh, so now GBTI launching private banking services is a problem too?\nLet me explain something to the people who never left Guyana: In EVERY developed economy, banks offer different levels of service. When your economy grows, your financial sector MUST grow with it.\nPresident Ali said it perfectly: “Private banking is not about stratifying customers or exclusion, it is about meeting different demands in a more sophisticated economy.”\nGuyana GDP growing at 14% annually! We have new investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses that need specialized financial services. This is a SIGN OF PROGRESS!\nBut nah, the Daily Brief want to make jokes. “Special bank for rich people!”\nYou know what happen when rich people and investors CAN’T get proper banking services? THEY TAKE THEIR MONEY ELSEWHERE!\nThe Brief complaining about brain drain but then mock the services that keep successful Guyanese investing at home. Make it make sense!\n🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE MOVING — STOP THE AMNESIA! The Campbellville Polyclinic — $831 million investment in healthcare! Taking shape! Going to serve THOUSANDS of Guyanese!\nAnd what the Brief do? Immediately pivot to “but what about the Day and Night Care Facility?”\nLet me address this directly: Minister Vindhya Persaud already explained that facility opening “cannot be rushed.” There’s proper procedures, staffing, licensing — these things take time!\nThe opposition (specifically WIN party) running around taking photos of grass growing on fences and calling it “election gimmick.” These are the same people who couldn’t build a outhouse in their 23 years of coalition governments!\nNow they experts on facility commissioning timelines?\n🏏 CRICKET: WE’RE STILL DEFENDING CHAMPIONS! Guyana Women lost ONE match by 7 runs and suddenly the sky falling?\nLet me remind everyone:\n🏆 GUYANA ARE THE DEFENDING T20 BLAZE CHAMPIONS\n🏆 Won the title last year after going UNDEFEATED\n🏆 Won Round 1 against Windward Islands\nOne bad game against Leeward Islands (who are actually playing well this tournament) and people panicking?\nTonight we face Jamaica at 7 PM. Jamaica lost BOTH their matches. Our spinners Ashmini Munisar and Plaffianna Millington have been DOMINANT.\nCaptain Shemaine Campbelle knows what it takes to win. This team has championship DNA.\nMy Prediction: Guyana by 25+ runs. Book it!\n📊 THE REAL PICTURE While the Daily Brief busy making jokes, here’s what’s ACTUALLY happening in Guyana:\nThis Week’s Progress:\nAchievement Impact 5th Solar Farm Commissioned 3,500 households benefit GBTI Private Banking Launch Financial sector modernization Campbellville Polyclinic Progress Healthcare infrastructure 85 Land Titles Issued Housing programme continues Civic \u0026 Moral Education in Schools Building better citizens Security Company Arrested Law enforcement working Six positive developments in ONE week! But you wouldn’t know that reading the Daily Brief!\n🎤 UNCLE RAMESH FINAL WORD From my apartment here in Queens, looking at the snow outside, I thank God every day that Guyana is in capable hands.\nIs everything perfect? No. Does everything happen overnight? No.\nBut compare where we at today versus 2015-2020 under the coalition. Compare the investment, the infrastructure, the vision, the execution.\nThe Daily Brief can keep making jokes. The people on the ground SEEING the changes. The diaspora SEEING the transformation.\nWhen I go home this Mashramani, I’ll be driving on new roads, seeing new buildings, and celebrating with my people. That’s what matters.\nTo the Guyana Women’s team: Go out there tonight and make us proud! 🏏\nTo President Ali and the PPP/C: Keep building, keep investing, keep ignoring the haters!\nTo my fellow Guyanese in the diaspora: Send home that barrel, call your family, and remember — Guyana on the rise!\nUncle Ramesh writing from Queens, NY — Where we does follow Guyana news religiously and support the homeland always!\n🇬🇾 One Guyana! One People! One Destiny! 🇬🇾\n","wordCount":"1036","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-01-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-17T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-17-uncle-ramesh-take/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Uncle Ramesh: Solar Success, Security Solutions, and Stop Crying Over Cricket!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 17, 2026</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p><em>Uncle Ramesh&rsquo;s Response from Queens, NY — Saturday, January 17, 2026</em></p><hr><p>Eh eh!
