## On the Energy Conference

FIFTH! Fifth Energy Conference! And the Brief treating it like a footnote between gun stories and funeral notices.

You know how many countries BEGGING for this kind of attention from global energy companies? But nah, the Brief want to question whether "the execution matches the PowerPoint."

Beta, the execution IS the PowerPoint. Five years ago, we had nothing. Now we have an ENERGY CONFERENCE. With GLOBAL LEADERS. At the MARRIOTT. With a DEEP-WATER PORT launching. With BRAZIL sending delegations.

The President say everything must be on point by 2030. You know what that is? That is a LEADER with a DEADLINE. When last you hear any opposition leader set a deadline for anything except their next adjournment?

## On Telemedicine

The Brief give credit — reluctantly — that telemedicine went from 4 to 130 sites. Good. Because that is FACTS and FACTS don't care about your editorial tone.

Dr. Mahadeo had to SCHOOL the opposition shadow minister in Parliament. The man come and disparage telemedicine without even understanding how it works. 15,000 people accessed these facilities. 6,363 patients used the system. Video consultations reaching people in the INTERIOR who would otherwise have to travel for DAYS.

But the Brief had to add that little jab: "Now if we could apply that same growth rate to water treatment." Everything is "but but but" with these people.

The New Hope Water Treatment Plant is literally in the news TODAY! GWI completed site assessment! 35,000 residents will benefit! But somehow that didn't make it into the Brief's big story, eh?

## On the Airports

Lethem and Rose Hall getting new airports. The Brief says "both are overdue." OVERDUE? Who was supposed to build them — the coalition that couldn't finish a road in five years?

This government is building airports, hospitals, training colleges, water treatment plants, and a deep-water port. ALL AT THE SAME TIME. And the criticism is "well, it's overdue."

You know what's overdue? An opposition that can offer an alternative instead of just being late to court.

## On Hakeem Olajuwon and TAJ Dream

The Brief want to be clever: "You'd need to save every dollar for 32 years."

Listen. When international investors of THAT calibre — NBA Hall of Famer, GLOBAL businessman — choose Guyana, that is a SIGNAL to the world. It means Guyana is INVESTABLE. It means our economy is TRUSTWORTHY. It means the political environment is STABLE.

And the US$100,000 discount for Guyanese? That is PREFERENTIAL treatment for citizens FIRST. The Brief acting like Guyanese don't have savings, don't have diaspora family, don't have options. Plenty Guyanese in New York and Toronto can make this work. And the development brings JOBS for those who can't.

But sure, make a joke about mortgage calculators. Very helpful.

## On the Health Campaign

The President directing a 6-WEEK nationwide health campaign. Partnering with religious leaders. Flyers, programmes, community outreach. PLUS a new teaching hospital in New Amsterdam — cardiac centre for the ENTIRE REGION.

This is GOVERNANCE. This is what it looks like when a leader actually CARES about people's health. Not talk. ACTION. Six-week deadline. Clear directive.

---

## On the 2020 Elections Trial

The Brief making jokes: "At this rate, they'll finish the trial just in time for the next election."

Beta, this isn't funny. People TRIED TO STEAL AN ELECTION. The trial takes time because the evidence is OVERWHELMING and the accused have a right to defence. You want rush justice? That's not how democracy works.

The fact that this trial is STILL happening means the system is WORKING. Slowly, yes. But working.

## What the Brief MISSED

1. **New Hope Water Treatment Plant** — GWI advancing infrastructure for 35,000 residents
2. **GPL engaging Ithaca farmers** — 230-kV transmission line consultation happening properly
3. **R3PSInc praising President Ali's Brazilian honour** — The Order of Merit Fort São Joaquim, highest award from Roraima state
4. **$20 billion Technical Training College** — Commissioned at Port Mourant, creating skilled workers for the oil economy

FOUR major positive developments the Brief either buried or skipped entirely. But the cameraman story? That got its own section.

---

## On What the Brief DID Cover

The Mohamed court drama — yes, he was late. Yes, a warrant was issued. The magistrate dealt with it. The man is facing a 25-page FEDERAL INDICTMENT from Miami. The court is doing its job. The PPP doesn't need to "orchestrate" anything — the American justice system is handling that just fine.

And the NCN cameraman situation — if the man did wrong, he will face the consequences. That's how law works. But Kaieteur turning it into a conspiracy theory with "senior government official" and "interesting" — that's not journalism, that's fan fiction.

## Uncle Ramesh's Score

| Paper | Reading | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Chronicle | Comprehensive | Reported on EVERY major development |
| Stabroek | Emotional | More eulogy than newspaper today |
| Kaieteur | Hostile | Still fighting a war only they believe in |
| Times | Steady | Doing its job quietly |

**Uncle Ramesh's Mood:** PROUD. This is a country building airports, launching ports, opening training colleges, expanding telemedicine, and attracting NBA investors. And somehow the headline is about a man who was 35 minutes late.

*Uncle Ramesh writes from Queens, NY. He reads all four papers every morning with his bush tea and has very strong opinions about everything. His views are his own, and the Daily Brief team accepts no responsibility for his blood pressure.*
