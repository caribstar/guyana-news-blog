**Speedeet:** Wha bank? Me nah got nothing to PUT in a bank.

**Wilar:** Nah, dis one GIVE yuh money. Interest-free. No collateral.

**Speedeet:** *(suspicious)* Somebody giving away free money? Dat sound like when Marcus on Pike Street seh he got "investment opportunity" and everybody lose dem savings.

**Wilar:** Nah bai, dis is GOVERNMENT ting. US$100 million. Fuh youth and women and people with disabilities.

**Speedeet:** Youth? Dat mean WE could get money?

**Speedeet:** Why not?! Me got PLANS. Me would open a doubles stand right by de school gate. EVERYBODY hungry at 10 o'clock.

**Wilar:** Yuh cyaan even make doubles.

**Speedeet:** Me would HIRE someone to make doubles. Dat is wha yuh call DELEGATION.

**Wilar:** Yuh learn dat word yesterday, didn't yuh?

**Speedeet:** Me mudda use it when she tell me to wash de dishes and I tell me little sister to do it instead. She seh "dat is not delegation, dat is laziness." But ME seh is de same ting with a better name.
