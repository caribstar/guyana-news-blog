## What Is This?

**The Guyana Brief** is your daily satirical digest of Guyana's news. Every morning, we read all four major newspapers (Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, Chronicle, and Guyana Times), then spend 5 minutes explaining what happened - with jokes.

Think *The Onion* meets *The Daily Show*, but exclusively about Guyana. And with way more coverage of The Mohameds' extradition saga.

## Why Do We Exist?

Because Guyana's news cycle is absolutely wild and someone needs to point that out. 

Where else can you find:
- A highway that needs repairs 13 months after being built
- An extradition case with more appeals than a telenovela has episodes  
- Bridges that crack before they're paid off
- Government promises with shorter lifespans than mayflies
- Infrastructure projects that treat timelines as mild suggestions

We love Guyana. That's why we can't stop laughing at it.

## What We're NOT

❌ **Real journalism** - We're satirical commentary  
❌ **News reporting** - We add jokes to real news  
❌ **Politically affiliated** - We mock everyone equally  
❌ **Serious** - Have you read our content?

## What We ARE

✅ **Satirical** - Like The Onion, but everything is actually true  
✅ **Daily** - New brief every day by noon (Guyana time)  
✅ **Free** - No paywall, no subscription, no BS  
✅ **Comprehensive** - We actually read all 4 papers so you don't have to

## Our Promise

Every day, we will:
1. Read all four major Guyana newspapers
2. Find the most absurd, frustrating, or hilarious stories
3. Write about them with appropriate levels of sarcasm
4. Deliver it to you in 5-6 minutes
5. Never, ever get tired of The Mohameds saga
