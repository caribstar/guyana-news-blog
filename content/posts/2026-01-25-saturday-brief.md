## 🔥 THE BIG ONE: Opposition Leader Vote Set for Monday

**The Story:** After weeks of constitutional drama that would make a telenovela writer jealous, Speaker Manzoor Nadir has finally announced that Opposition MPs will meet Monday at 10:00 hrs to elect the Leader of the Opposition — right before the National Assembly presentation.

**The Candidate:** Azruddin Mohamed, the US-sanctioned, OFAC-listed, extradition-fighting businessman-turned-politician whose WIN party somehow became the largest opposition force.

**The Drama:** Former Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy says Guyana risks "global embarrassment" by potentially electing someone facing US criminal charges to one of the most important constitutional positions. He compared it unfavorably to Singapore, which removed their opposition leader from his post over criminal matters.

"Singapore acted to protect the integrity of its parliament. In Guyana, we are about to do the opposite," Ramsammy noted.

**Rights Groups Pile On:** The Association of People of African Descent (APAD) has formally registered concerns, calling on Opposition MPs to "place country above faction." They pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition participates in several constitutional appointments and democratic oversight functions.

**The Charges:** According to US prosecutors, Mohamed's Enterprise allegedly evaded Guyana's gold export taxes, conspired to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering, smuggled drugs, and omitted more than 10,000 kilograms of gold from declarations — avoiding over $50 million in taxes.

**The Bottom Line:** Monday should be interesting. Very, very interesting.

## 🦟 CHIKUNGUNYA ALERT: Suriname Outbreak Has Guyana on Watch

Health Minister Dr. Frank Anthony says Guyana is issuing alerts to all health facilities after Suriname confirmed eight cases of chikungunya — and none of those patients traveled overseas.

The mosquito-borne disease causes severe body pains and fever. Dr. Anthony says Guyana's surveillance system is "fairly robust" and hospitals will test for dengue first, then other infections.

**Translation:** "We're watching, but please also clean up the stagnant water around your house because we trained the NDCs to fog but... you know how that goes."

## 👩‍💼 WOMEN'S CHAMBER: Tackling Care Work, Finance Gaps, and Gender Violence

The Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industry Guyana (WCCIG) is expanding its focus beyond traditional business support. Under President Josephine Tapp and VP Shamela John, they're tackling:

- Access to finance for women entrepreneurs
- Care work infrastructure (who watches the children while you're building an empire?)
- Gender-responsive government procurement
- Gender-based violence

The Women Evolve Initiative specifically helps women transitioning from "structured employment" to business ownership — because apparently lots of women make it to year two or three then exit because nobody taught them how to handle business finances.

**Quote of the Day:** "A lot of women make it to the second or third year and then exit because they didn't structure their finances."

## ✈️ AIRLINES CUTTING HINTERLAND FARES: Progress!

Multiple airlines have now announced fare reductions following President Ali's call:

| Airline | Reduction | Effective |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Roraima Airways | 7% | Immediate |
| Trans Guyana Airways | 7% | January 2026 |
| Jags Aviation | TBD | February 1, 2026 |

President Ali's target is 15%, so they're halfway there. Roraima notably applied the reduction to ALL rehabilitated airstrips, not just selected destinations.

Captain Gerry Gouveia Jr.: "If infrastructure improves, all communities should benefit."

## 🚢 ONE FREEDOM CRUISE SHIP: Tourism Minister Takes Test Ride

Tourism Minister Susan Rodrigues took a "breathtaking journey" aboard the One Freedom, Guyana Glory Passenger Cruise Ship across the Demerara River and into the Atlantic Ocean.

The ship boasts 46 self-contained, double occupancy rooms, a gym, and other attractions.

**Translation:** Guyana is really trying this river tourism thing. Let's see if tourists want to cruise the Demerara as much as they want to see Kaieteur.

## 📊 QUICK HITS

**Crime Stats:** Murders UP 11.1% (130 vs 117 in 2024), but overall "serious crimes" DOWN 25.5%. Make of that what you will.

**Tabatinga Secondary School:** Opposition MPs visited and said it's "far from operational readiness." Government probably disagrees.

**Law Year 2026 Opens:** AG Nandlall criticized courts for not applying modern legislation; Chancellor George called for honoring judicial financial autonomy provisions.

**Suspected Murder-Suicide:** Two guest house employees found dead at Lime Street, Werk-en-Rust. Police investigating.

## 🗞️ THE NEWSPAPER WARS CONTINUE

**Guyana Chronicle:** Published a piece calling Stabroek News columnist Bertrand Ramcharran "despicable" and "repellent" for praising a former Mossad head. Also called the SN's online comment section "sycophantic eulogy and psychotic anti-government pyrotechnics."

**Stabroek News:** Continues to ask why the Speaker took so long to schedule the Opposition Leader vote.

**Kaieteur News:** Running columns asking if Guyana is a "vassal state" beholden to the US. Also detailed how the 2016 oil contract allows Exxon to use profits from one field to pay for exploration in others, keeping Guyana's profit share "perpetually out of reach."

**Guyana Times:** Covering government achievements. Water is also wet.

## 💭 FINAL THOUGHT

Monday's National Assembly sitting will be historic one way or another. Either Guyana elects a US-sanctioned businessman as Leader of the Opposition, or... well, there doesn't seem to be a Plan B.

As Dr. Henry Jeffrey wrote: "Incumbents can and do totally ignore the opposition." Which raises the question — does it even matter who leads an opposition that gets ignored anyway?

See you Monday for the drama! 🍿
