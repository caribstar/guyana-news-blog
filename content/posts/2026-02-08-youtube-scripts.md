SPEEDEET: Yep! US$2.3 billion for the last one. And you know what ringfencing is?

WILAR: Nah, what dat?

SPEEDEET: EXACTLY! Nobody in Guyana know either, because we don't HAVE it! It means Exxon can spend money on one project and take it back from another one. Like if you buy lunch and charge it to MY allowance!

## 🎬 4-MINUTE SCRIPT

**[SPEEDEET and WILAR sitting at a desk with newspapers spread out]**

SPEEDEET: Good morning everybody! It's Sunday February 8th, and boy, the news is BUSY today.

WILAR: We reading ALL four papers this morning — Kaieteur, Stabroek, Chronicle, and Times. Like proper journalists!

SPEEDEET: First big story — ExxonMobil now owns ALL FOUR oil production ships in the Stabroek Block. They just finished buying the biggest one for US$2.3 billion dollars.

WILAR: Wait, Speedeet. Can you explain what an FPSO is? Some of our friends might not know.

SPEEDEET: Sure! FPSO stands for Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading vessel. It's basically a GIANT ship that sits in the ocean, pumps oil from under the seabed, stores it, and then loads it onto tanker ships. Guyana has FOUR of them now — all owned by Exxon.

WILAR: So the oil comes from Guyana's water...

SPEEDEET: Correct.

WILAR: And gets pumped by Exxon's ship...

SPEEDEET: Also correct.

WILAR: And Guyana gets...

SPEEDEET: A percentage. After Exxon takes back their costs. Without ringfencing. Which means they can lump all their expenses together across all four operations.

WILAR: Hmm. Okay, moving on before I get upset. What else happening?

SPEEDEET: Budget debate wrapped up! Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh gave his closing speech and he actually compared a political situation to Pablo Escobar!

WILAR: The drug lord from Colombia?!

SPEEDEET: Yes! He was making a point about not using politics to escape criminal accountability. It was very dramatic. Parliament was basically a movie this week.

WILAR: Meanwhile, the Opposition Leader said the budget won't lift people out of poverty.

SPEEDEET: And the Chronicle ran about ten articles saying it's the greatest budget ever.

WILAR: So who's right?

SPEEDEET: That's why you gotta read ALL the papers, Wilar. Different papers, different perspectives. Critical thinking is YOUR superpower.

WILAR: Okay, now for some HAPPY news!

SPEEDEET: Yes! Doctors at Georgetown Public Hospital saved a mother AND baby from a super rare bleeding disorder. They're calling it a miracle birth. Those doctors are absolute heroes.

WILAR: We love our healthcare workers! Shoutout to all the nurses and doctors!

SPEEDEET: Now — Black History Month! This year is EXTRA special. It's 100 years since the first Negro History Week AND 400 years since Africans first arrived in Guyana.

WILAR: ACDA is visiting 20 schools this month to teach students about Afro-Guyanese history and heritage. I hope they come to OUR school!

SPEEDEET: They're also building an African village exhibition — each tent showing a different period of history. That sounds amazing.

WILAR: Education isn't just math and English. It's knowing WHERE you come from so you know WHERE you're going.

SPEEDEET: Deep, Wilar. Very deep.

WILAR: I have my moments. What about cricket?

SPEEDEET: T20 WORLD CUP STARTED! West Indies beat Scotland in the opener! Shimron Hetmyer hit a big fifty — explosive stuff!

WILAR: HETMYER! That's OUR boy! Guyanese! From Enmore!

SPEEDEET: And the tournament is in India and Sri Lanka, so we gotta stay up late to watch some matches.

WILAR: My parents not gon like that.

SPEEDEET: Tell them it's educational. International sports. Geography. Cultural exchange.

WILAR: *laughs* I'll try that. Anything else?

SPEEDEET: President Ali told the GDF to stay ready regarding Venezuela. He said "Guyana must not blink." And $25.4 billion is going into green energy — renewable power up sevenfold in five years.

WILAR: So eventually GPL might stop cutting we current?

SPEEDEET: *laughs* That's the dream, Wilar. That's the dream.

WILAR: Alright everyone — that's your Sunday news roundup!

SPEEDEET: Read your papers, support your doctors, celebrate your history, and cheer for West Indies!

BOTH: See you tomorrow, Guyana! 🇬🇾
