*From Queens, New York — Where we understand fiscal responsibility* 🇬🇾🗽

## Greetings from the Diaspora!

Ah, another day, another set of headlines from Guyana that the critics want to twist into something negative. But Uncle Ramesh here to set the record straight for all my fellow Guyanese overseas who want to understand what's REALLY happening in we homeland.

## 💰 ON CASH GRANTS: RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP

So the President said cash grants are "not sustainable," and suddenly everybody vex? Let me ask you something: which responsible government just keeps handing out money without a plan?

You know what ISN'T sustainable? The way the APNU+AFC coalition ran the economy into the ground. You know what IS sustainable? Investing in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and REAL development that creates jobs and opportunities.

The President is thinking LONG TERM. He's not trying to win popularity contests — he's trying to build a nation. Some of you want the government to hand out fish every day. This government teaching people to fish AND building the fish processing plant AND connecting it to the deep-water port.

**My cousin Suresh from Richmond Hill says:** "Ramesh, but they promised cash grants!" 

Suresh, they also promised transformation, and look — Gas-to-Energy coming online, new hospitals, schools, roads everywhere. You want $100,000 in your hand or you want a country where your grandchildren can actually live and prosper?

## 🏙️ ON GEORGETOWN: FINALLY SOMEONE SAYING THE TRUTH

Minister Manickchand called Georgetown "unacceptable." You know who should be embarrassed? CITY HALL. Not the government.

The PPP/C government has been building world-class infrastructure across the country — new highways, new bridges, new everything. Meanwhile, City Hall can't even collect garbage properly. 

The Minister is doing her job — holding local government accountable. This is what good governance looks like. She's not making excuses. She's saying "fix it or explain yourself."

But watch how the critics will spin this: "Government attacking City Hall!" No, no, no. Government is HELPING City Hall by telling them the truth. Sometimes you need tough love.

## 👩‍🏫 ON TEACHERS: THE FACTS MATTER

The GTU wants a meeting? The Teaching Service Commission has been reconstituted. The 2024-2026 salary agreement is in place — 27% increase over three years! Teachers are getting degrees paid for through GOAL. Remote area incentives increased by 156%.

But the GTU president is also an opposition politician. So forgive the government if they're cautious about mixing education policy with political grandstanding.

The teachers will get their promotions. The process is moving. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was a modern education system.

## ⛽ ON GAS-TO-ENERGY: PROGRESS IS PROGRESS

The critics laugh because "control rooms arrived." You know what? That IS progress. That IS a milestone. 

Do you know how complex this project is? We're talking about bringing natural gas from offshore, through a pipeline, to a power plant that will cut electricity costs for every single Guyanese. This is generational transformation.

Every piece of equipment that arrives is another step closer. By the end of 2026, Guyanese will have reliable, affordable power. The same critics who laughed will be the first ones to enjoy cheaper electricity bills.

## 🏥 ON THE HOSPITAL TRAGEDY

This is a genuine tragedy, and my heart goes out to the family. The hospital is investigating, as they should.

But let me remind everyone: this same government launched the National Electronic Health Record System just days ago. They're modernizing healthcare across the country. Mental health services are being expanded. The suicide prevention hotline (915) is available.

One tragic incident doesn't define an entire healthcare system that is being transformed and improved every single day.

## 🚢 ON THE NEW VESSEL

A brand new ship from Greece to serve Region One! Air-conditioned, modern, safe. This is what investment in the hinterland looks like.

The APNU+AFC talked about hinterland development. The PPP/C is DOING hinterland development. New roads, new boats, new schools, new opportunities.

---

## 🗳️ ON THE OPPOSITION LEADER SITUATION

You want to know why there's no Opposition Leader? Ask the opposition! They can't even agree among themselves who should lead.

The government has said clearly — this is a parliamentary matter. The Speaker will handle it according to the Constitution. But the opposition parties are fighting each other while trying to blame the government.

Maybe if they spent less time writing letters to newspapers and more time getting their house in order, they'd have a leader by now.

## 📊 ON INFLATION

Yes, food prices have increased. You know what else increased? Minimum wage. Public sector salaries. Cash grants (when they were given). Old age pension. 

And let's be real — inflation is a GLOBAL phenomenon. You think groceries are cheaper here in New York? Everywhere in the world prices went up after COVID. The difference is, Guyana's economy is GROWING while others are stagnating.

The government is working on it. Local content requirements, support for farmers, new agricultural initiatives. Solutions take time.

## 🎯 UNCLE RAMESH'S FINAL WORD

Every week, the critics find something new to complain about. Cash grants not sustainable? Complaint. Georgetown dirty? Blame government (not City Hall). Teachers want faster promotions? Government's fault.

Meanwhile, this government is:
- Building a Gas-to-Energy plant
- Constructing a new Demerara River bridge
- Modernizing hospitals with electronic records
- Bringing new vessels for hinterland communities
- Paving roads across the country
- Creating jobs and opportunities

The diaspora sees it. When we visit home, we see the transformation with our own eyes. Don't let the negativity blind you to the progress.

Guyana is rising. Whether the critics like it or not.
