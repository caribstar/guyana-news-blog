*Uncle Ramesh read de papers from Brooklyn dis morning and he got PLENTY to say.*

---

Eh-eh! So de President gone Brazil, get de highest honour from Roraima state, talk about trade and food security and energy cooperation — and all-you STILL finding fault? De man building bridges — LITERAL bridges — between two countries and de opposition side chatting bout "we heard this before."

You know what I hearing from Lethem side? People EXCITED. Brazilian business people coming over, Guyanese going across. Dat is REAL economic activity, not paper talk. When last time de opposition build a relationship with ANYBODY? Dey can't even get along with deyself, much less a whole country.

Now leh me talk bout dis Committee of Supply business because de blog making it sound like everything bad.

**Teacher vacancies?** Yes, 2,800 senior teacher positions vacant. But you know WHY? Because dis government EXPANDING de education system! More schools, more programs, more positions. Under APNU yuh didn't have vacancies because yuh didn't have NOTHING. No expansion, no investment, no vision. Vacancy mean GROWTH, people.

**Youth Council getting $75 million?** Good! Virtual academic lessons, health campaigns, digital platforms for young people. De blog calling it "another government database" but when Granger was in power, young people couldn't even get a CALL BACK from government. Now dey getting $75 million worth of programs. Sit down.

**Housing lands from June?** $119 million for surveys across multiple regions. Dis government distribute MORE house lots than any government in HISTORY. De numbers don't lie. When APNU was in, people couldn't get a house lot if dey BEGGED. Now Teixeira say new lands coming from June. I believe she.

And dis Kato hydropower story — 24 buildings getting reliable electricity, 17 people employed, 5 women trained in plant operations. DIS is what development look like in indigenous communities. You think Granger ever put a hydropower plant in Kato? De man couldn't even keep Georgetown lights on!

**158 contractors bidding for $10 billion in Leonora infrastructure?** Dat is COMPETITION. Dat is de private sector responding to government investment. When you have 158 companies fighting for work, dat mean de economy MOVING. Under APNU, contractors was running FROM government work because dey never get paid.

Now, de blog want talk bout de Commissioner of Information getting $40 million without producing reports. I ain't going defend dat fully — Ramson Snr need to produce he reports. But leh me ask dis: WHERE was de opposition demanding these reports for de last 5 years? Sarabo-Halley now discovering accountability? She was in APNU cabinet when dey couldn't account for HALF de national budget!

And speaking of Sarabo-Halley — she talking bout a hospital flooding? First of all, show me de EVIDENCE. One MP making claims in Parliament don't make it fact. Second, even IF there's a water issue in ONE building, dis government build MORE hospitals, health centres, and medical facilities than any government EVER. One maintenance issue don't erase billions in healthcare investment.

De Kaieteur editorial saying PPP "lost" de budget debate? PLEASE. Kaieteur been saying PPP losing since 1992 and de party win EVERY election since. De people know who delivering. De people know who building roads, schools, hospitals, stadiums. De people know who giving cash grants, house lots, and scholarships.

Kaieteur calling government MPs "crass and ill-mannered" — dis from de same paper dat calling de President a dictator every other Tuesday? Glass house, meet stone.

**RAMESH SPECIAL ADDITION — Stories de Brief Missed:**

📌 **Bayroc Stadium opened in Linden!** President Ali himself went to Linden Saturday night for de grand opening of de Bayroc National Stadium — Linden FIRST-EVER proper track and field facility. Dis is MASSIVE for Region 10. But de blog ain't mention it because good news from PPP don't fit de narrative.

📌 **Budget 2026 balances relief with poverty solutions** — An economist (not a politician, an ECONOMIST) said Budget 2026 delivers both immediate relief and long-term structural change. But you won't read dat in Kaieteur.

📌 **Ali warned against "shallow politics"** — De President himself said Guyana's political culture at risk from greed and superficial engagement. He calling for BETTER politics. De opposition should listen.

All-you could keep complaining from yuh air-conditioned apartment in New York. Down in Guyana, people building. People working. People LIVING.
