## &#x1F3AD; THE MOHAMEDS PRESENT: "THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE" (THE MUSICAL)

<div style="background: #FFE5E5; border-left: 5px solid #F44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
<strong>&#x1F3AC; THIS WEEK'S MOHAMED THEATER:</strong><br>
Courtroom Drama: &#x2705; CHECK<br>
Appeal to Full Court: &#x2705; CHECK<br>
Op-Ed About Persecution: &#x2705; CHECK<br>
Lawyer Catchphrase: "The Mohameds are NOT going anywhere!"<br>
</div>

This week, the Mohamed legal saga reached peak absurdity. Let's recap the highlights:

**This Week's Timeline:**
- Monday: Acting Chief Justice says "No stay"
- Monday (5 minutes later): Defense appeals to Full Court
- Tuesday: Courtroom drama with first witness
- Thursday: More drama with "late evidence"
- Friday: Nazar's op-ed declares "government declared war on his family"

**Defense Attorney's Battle Cry:** "The Mohameds are NOT going anywhere."

**Translation:** "We will appeal until the heat death of the universe."

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; border: 2px dashed #6c757d;">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin: 0;"><strong>&#x2696;&#xFE0F; THE MOHAMED APPEAL-O-METER &#x2696;&#xFE0F;</strong></p>
<hr style="margin: 15px 0;">
<p><strong>&#x1F4F0; Kaieteur News Articles Written:</strong> 4,000+ (literally)</p>
<p><strong>&#x2696;&#xFE0F; Courts Appealed To:</strong> All of them</p>
<p><strong>&#x1F4C5; Next Hearing:</strong> February 5 (unless they delay the delay)</p>
<p><strong>&#x1F3AA; Legal Strategy:</strong> "Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"</p>
</div>

**The Grievances (According to Nazar's Op-Ed):**

1. Insurance won't cover his bulletproof vehicles (The AUDACITY!)
2. GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping commit fraud, but details!)
3. His lands are being "illegally occupied" by squatters (more on this later)
4. Government using "political influence" (says the guy facing fraud charges)

**Kaieteur News Coverage:** Has written more words about the Mohameds than Shakespeare wrote plays. They could publish a 47-volume encyclopedia at this point.

**The Pattern:** Court says no &#x2192; Lawyers appeal &#x2192; Court says no again &#x2192; Lawyers appeal the appeal &#x2192; Repeat until Florida gives up

**Florida's Patience Level:** Approaching absolute zero

## &#x1F3D7;&#xFE0F; HEROES HIGHWAY: THE SEQUEL NOBODY ASKED FOR

<div style="background: #FFE5E5; border: 3px solid #FF4444; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px; margin: 0;"><strong>&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; INFRASTRUCTURE HALL OF SHAME &#x26A0;&#xFE0F;</strong></p>
<hr style="border-color: #FF4444; margin: 15px 0;">
<p><strong>Built:</strong> December 2023 (concrete)</p>
<p><strong>Lasted:</strong> 25 months</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Cover with asphalt</p>
<p><strong>Defense:</strong> "This was always the plan!"</p>
</div>

Remember Heroes Highway? The concrete road commissioned December 2023? It needs repairs already!

**Government:** "We always planned to put asphalt over the concrete!"

**Everyone:** "Then why use concrete at all?"

**Government:** *crickets*

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #28a745;">
<p><strong>&#x1F4CB; INFRASTRUCTURE LOGIC:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elsewhere:</strong> Build road properly &#x2192; Use 20-30 years &#x2705;</p>
<p><strong>Guyana:</strong> Build concrete &#x2192; Realize it's uneven &#x2192; Cover with asphalt &#x2192; Spend millions more &#x1F4B8;</p>
</div>

**The Timeline:**
- December 2023: Highway commissioned
- March 2025: US Secretary Rubio says "we almost had concussions"
- April 2025: Ali announces overlay was "always the plan"
- January 2026: Bids invited for asphalt overlay

**Original Cost:** $13.9 billion (12 contractors)

**Additional Cost:** Millions more for asphalt

**What We Could've Done:** Built proper asphalt road from start

**What We Did:** Speed-run concrete, then fix with asphalt

## &#x1F4C8; CRIME STATS: THE NUMBERS GAME

<div style="background: #FFEBEE; border-left: 5px solid #F44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
<strong>&#x1F4CA; 2025 CRIME STATISTICS:</strong><br>
Murders: &#x2B06;&#xFE0F; UP 11% (130 total)<br>
Road Deaths: &#x2B06;&#xFE0F; UP 6% (137 total)<br>
Overall Serious Crimes: &#x2B07;&#xFE0F; DOWN 25.5%<br>
Government: "Crime is down!"<br>
Public: "But more people died?"
</div>

The Police released 2025 stats. Depending on which metric you pick, Guyana is either safer or deadlier.

**Good News:** Serious crimes down 25.5% (from 1,235 to 920 cases)

**Bad News:** 130 murders + 137 road deaths = 267 people died violently

**Government's Press Release:** "Significant crime reduction!"

**Reality:** More people were murdered and killed on roads than 2024.

**The Spin vs The Truth:** Focus on percentages, ignore the body count.

## &#x1F937; THE OPPOSITION: STILL MISSING

<div style="background: #FFF3CD; border: 3px solid #FFC107; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px; margin: 0;"><strong>&#x1F6A8; MISSING PERSON ALERT &#x1F6A8;</strong></p>
<hr style="margin: 15px 0;">
<p><strong>NAME:</strong> The Opposition Leader</p>
<p><strong>LAST SEEN:</strong> Never (Parliament convened November 2025)</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Still not elected</p>
<p><strong>REASON:</strong> Mohamed extradition freezes everything</p>
</div>

Parliament convened in November. Still no Opposition Leader. Why? Azruddin Mohamed (WIN's leader with 16 seats) is fighting extradition.

**WIN's Warning:** "No Opposition Leader, No Oversight"

**The Irony:** The presumptive Opposition Leader is too busy fighting fraud charges to lead.

**Kaieteur's Savage Quote:** "It's almost as if the opposition is in [the PPP's] fold, under its control"

**Expected Resolution:** February 5... or whenever appeals finish... so maybe 2030?

## &#x1F3E1; SQUATTER GATE: MOHAMED'S LAND DRAMA

Nazar Mohamed claims squatters invaded his East Bank Demerara land near Heroes Highway. He alleges government officials encouraged them.

**His Response:** "I will demolish any structures they build."

**The Squatters:** "Someone said Mohamed gave out the land."

**The Twist:** Police who responded were allegedly transferred immediately.

**The Conspiracy Theory:** Political vindictiveness over extradition

**Reality:** Nobody knows, but it's great drama

## &#x26A1; GPL: CONTRACTORS STILL CAN'T SEE POWER LINES

GPL issued another weekly warning about contractors threatening the grid. The pattern continues: contractor does something dangerous &#x2192; GPL warns &#x2192; repeat next week.

## &#x1F4AD; SUNDAY WISDOM

In a country where:
- Legal cases produce more appeals than actual verdicts
- A 2-year-old highway needs millions in repairs
- Crime is simultaneously up and down
- The opposition doesn't have a leader

At least we can laugh about it. That's something, right?

**Stay informed, Guyana. And lawyers? Keep those billing hours coming.** &#x2696;&#xFE0F;
