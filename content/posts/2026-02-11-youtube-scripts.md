## 🎬 60-SECOND SCRIPT (HeyGen Quick Brief)

**[TITLE CARD: GUYANA BRIEF - WEDNESDAY FEB 11]**

Good morning Guyana! Here's your Wednesday in sixty seconds.

First — Transparency International says we moved up ONE point on the corruption index. Score? Forty out of a hundred. The government is celebrating. Kaieteur says we're still corrupt. Both are right.

Second — Agriculture Ministry just blacklisted thirty contractors for bad work. But get this — one pump station awarded to a social media influencer is only twenty-nine percent done. You can't make this up.

Third — Gas-to-Energy is sixty-eight percent complete. President Ali toured Brazil's gas plant for ideas. Electricity bills could drop fifty percent when it's done.

Fourth — the Guyana flag appeared at the Super Bowl halftime show and people are FIGHTING about it. Some say we don't belong. Others say free exposure is free exposure.

And across the Caribbean — Barbados is voting TODAY. Mia Mottley wants a historic third term. Cuba just went to a four-day work week because they have no fuel. And Trinidad Carnival is five days away!

That's your Wednesday. Stay informed, stay Guyanese.

## 🎬 4-MINUTE SCRIPT (HeyGen Deep Dive)

**[TITLE CARD: GUYANA BRIEF - WEDNESDAY FEB 11 - FULL REPORT]**

Good morning Guyana and welcome to your Wednesday Deep Dive. Big day today — lots to cover. Let's get into it.

**[SECTION 1: CORRUPTION INDEX]**

Starting with the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. Guyana scored forty out of a hundred — up from thirty-nine last year. We're now ranked eighty-fourth out of a hundred and eighty-four countries.

Now, the Chronicle is celebrating this as progress. And technically, it is. We moved up. But Kaieteur is pointing out that the same report flagged Guyana for intimidating independent media and civil society. The watchdog group says this is weakening accountability.

So which is it? Progress or pretence? Honestly, it's both. One point is movement. But forty out of a hundred is still a failing grade anywhere in the world. And when the same report that gives you credit also warns about press freedom — maybe hold the champagne.

**[SECTION 2: BLACKLISTED CONTRACTORS]**

Now to the budget debates. Agriculture Minister Mustapha told Parliament that thirty contractors have been blacklisted for delinquent work. That sounds like accountability — and in some ways it is.

But Stabroek News dug into the details and found that the Belle Vue pump station is only twenty-nine percent complete. Why? Because the contract was awarded to a social media influencer with no experience in this kind of work. Twenty-nine percent. Meanwhile, pump stations handled by experienced contractors? Eighty-three percent done.

And separately, Kaieteur is reporting that a government critic's company got blacklisted. So the question becomes: is the blacklist about quality control or about who's loyal?

**[SECTION 3: GAS-TO-ENERGY]**

The Gas-to-Energy project is now sixty-eight percent complete according to Prime Minister Phillips. The budget has approved another ten point seven billion dollars for it in twenty-twenty-six.

Meanwhile, President Ali was in Brazil touring the Jaguatirica II gas plant in Roraima. That's a hundred and forty-one megawatt facility that powers most of that state. He received Brazil's highest honour while there.

The promise remains: when this project is done, electricity costs drop from twenty-two cents to eleven cents per kilowatt-hour. Fifty percent reduction. If it delivers — and that's a big if — this transforms the economy. But five years in at sixty-eight percent, people are getting impatient.

**[SECTION 4: SUPER BOWL FLAG]**

And now for something completely different. The Guyana flag appeared during Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. And Guyanese people cannot agree if this is good or bad.

A letter writer in Stabroek News says Guyana has no connection to American football and our flag had no business being there. Fair point. But hundreds of thousands of Guyanese Americans live in the US, pay taxes, and contribute to American life every single day. Free exposure on the world's biggest stage? Most countries would pay millions for that.

Uncle Ramesh nearly fell off his couch in Queens. His WhatsApp group exploded. So there you go.

**[SECTION 5: CARIBBEAN]**

Quick Caribbean update: Barbados is voting TODAY. Mia Mottley wants a historic third consecutive term. Polls opened at six AM. Results expected tonight.

Cuba adopted a four-day work week — not because they're progressive, but because they have no fuel. Airlines can't even refuel on the island anymore.

Jamaica was rattled by a five-point-oh earthquake yesterday. No major damage but Kingston residents got an early wake-up call.

And Trinidad Carnival is five days away. Get your costumes ready.

**[CLOSING]**

That's your Wednesday Deep Dive. The budget debates continue, Barbados results come in tonight, and somewhere in Belle Vue a pump station sits at twenty-nine percent wondering what went wrong.

Stay informed. Stay skeptical. Stay Guyanese.
