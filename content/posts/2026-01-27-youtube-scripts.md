**SCRIPT:**

Good day everyone! Budget 2026 has officially dropped and we've got A LOT to unpack.

Senior Minister in the Office of the President with Responsibility for Finance, Dr. Ashni Singh, just presented a $1.588 TRILLION dollar budget to the National Assembly. That's a 15% increase from last year's $1.38 trillion.

Let me break down what this means for you.

[PAUSE]

**HOUSING — The Big Spend**

$159.1 BILLION is going to housing development. The government plans to distribute 15,000 new house lots and build 8,000 homes this year.

Dr. Singh said — and I quote — "Our investments in housing are not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride."

The focus is on reducing the backlog of applications outside Region Four. So if you've been waiting for a lot in Berbice, Essequibo, or the hinterland regions — things are supposed to speed up.

[PAUSE]

**SPECIAL NEEDS — A Historic Moment**

Now THIS is genuinely exciting news.

$316.5 million is allocated for special needs education and disability services. And the highlight? Guyana is getting its FIRST school specifically designed for autistic students. It will be built at the Cyril Potter College of Education campus.

For families who have been struggling to find proper educational support for special needs children — this is a game changer. Whatever your politics, this is progress.

[PAUSE]

**TOURISM — Breaking Records**

Here's a number that might surprise you: Guyana welcomed 453,489 visitors in 2025. That's the HIGHEST number EVER recorded.

The government is doubling down with:
- A new Hospitality and Tourism Institute training 700+ people
- 56 communities added to tourism circuits
- Air Transat launching twice-weekly flights to Toronto — that's 796 extra seats per week
- A push for diaspora tourism — weddings, reunions, conferences

Dr. Singh called it a "sustainable, diversified, people-centred tourism economy." The hotels are being built. Now we just need the airport to keep up.

[PAUSE]

**AGRICULTURE — The Rural Revolution**

$745 million is going to agro-processing this year.

New facilities are coming to Parika and Lethem. The Regional Food Hub at Yarrowkabra is expected to complete THIS YEAR. And 373 agro-processors have already been trained in packaging, labeling, and product presentation.

But here's the big news for farmers: Corporate tax has been REMOVED for agriculture and agro-processing businesses.

Plus, 25 Guyana Shop corners have been launched across the country — and one in Barbados — to promote locally-produced goods.

[PAUSE]

**BUSINESS REACTION**

The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry is happy. They praised the removal of corporate tax on agriculture, the US$100 million zero-interest development bank, and the VAT removal on locally made furniture and jewelry.

They called it "transformational" for small and medium businesses.

[PAUSE]

**OPPOSITION RESPONSE**

Now, the opposition wasn't consulted on this budget. APNU leader Aubrey Norton said two weeks ago — and I quote — "The government doesn't engage, because in their opinion, they will look as though they are taking ideas from us."

MP Sharma Solomon pointed to independent statistics showing a 58% poverty rate.

Norton predicted "the same old budget." 

Well... he got a bigger budget. Whether it addresses poverty comprehensively — that's the debate that will continue.

[PAUSE]

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Budget 2026 is BIG. $1.588 trillion in spending, 14.3% economic growth in 2025, record tourism, historic special needs investment, and major agricultural support.

Whether it reaches the people who need it most — that's the question every Guyanese should be asking.
