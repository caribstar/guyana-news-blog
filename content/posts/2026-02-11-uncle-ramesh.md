## On the Corruption Index

Beta, BETA! You see?! ONE POINT UP! That is PROGRESS!

You know how hard it is to move up even ONE point on these international rankings? You think Denmark woke up one morning at 90 points? NO! They built it BRICK BY BRICK! Just like the PPP building Guyana!

And let me tell you something about this Transparency International people. They sitting in Berlin, air conditioning blasting, telling Caribbean countries they corrupt. You know what I call that? IRONIC. Half of Europe colonised US and STOLE our resources and NOW they grading us on honesty?

But the PPP STILL improved! Under APNU we went DOWN. Under PPP we going UP. The math is simple, beta.

And this "intimidation of media" nonsense — Kaieteur News publishes whatever they want EVERY SINGLE DAY. You call that intimidation? In some countries, editors disappear. Here, editors get their own columns to curse the government! That is FREEDOM!

## On the 30 Blacklisted Contractors

THIS! THIS IS ACCOUNTABILITY!

The Brief trying to make this sound bad. Thirty contractors BLACKLISTED! You know what that means? It means the government is HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE!

Under APNU, contractors did sloppy work and got MORE contracts. Under PPP? You mess up, you get CUT. That is how a REAL government operates.

And this Belle Vue pump station story — yes, it's at 29%. You know why? Because the CONTRACTOR failed, not the GOVERNMENT. The government is PUNISHING bad contractors! That's LITERALLY what the blacklist is for!

But no, Kaieteur wants to focus on WHO got the contract instead of celebrating that the government is actually FIXING the problem. Classic Kaieteur. The house is on fire and they complaining about the colour of the fire truck.

## On Gas-to-Energy

The President personally toured Brazil's gas plant! He studying SUCCESSFUL MODELS! He meeting with FOREIGN LEADERS! He getting Brazil's HIGHEST HONOUR!

And what the Brief does? "Five years in and we're still at 68%."

Beta. Building a 300-megawatt power plant is not like building a chicken coop. Sixty-eight percent in five years for a project this size? That is EXCELLENT. Go check how long it took Trinidad to build their gas infrastructure. Go check. I'll wait.

And when this thing done — FIFTY PERCENT reduction in electricity bills. FIFTY. Every household in Guyana saving money. Every business saving money. But Kaieteur will find something to complain about. "The light too bright!" "The electricity too cheap!" Always something.

## On Sugar

You people does laugh at sugar. But let me tell you something — sugar is HERITAGE. Sugar is CULTURE. Sugar is the backbone of communities from Berbice to Demerara.

When APNU shut down those estates, they didn't just close factories. They destroyed FAMILIES. Seven thousand people on the breadline! Children going hungry! And now the PPP investing $13.4 BILLION to bring it back, and you want to make jokes?

One hundred thousand tonnes target. Mechanisation. Factory upgrades. This is a PLAN. Not like APNU's plan which was "close everything and hope for the best."

You watch. By 2030, GuySuCo going be profitable. And when it happen, I want all the critics to line up and apologise. Starting with Kaieteur News editor.

## On the Guyana Flag at the Super Bowl

I NEARLY FALL OFF MY COUCH IN QUEENS!

You know how many Guyanese living in America? HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS! And you telling me we shouldn't be represented at the biggest event in American sports?

This letter writer in Stabroek saying we "haven't contributed to American football" — beta, Guyanese Americans CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA EVERY SINGLE DAY. We pay taxes. We build businesses. We raise families. We BUY Super Bowl tickets!

Bad Bunny showed the Caribbean flag and suddenly people vex? The WHOLE WORLD saw our Golden Arrowhead! Do you know how much that kind of exposure COSTS if you have to pay for it? MILLIONS! And we got it FREE!

My WhatsApp group in Queens exploded. Everybody recording the TV. Everybody sending screenshots. PRIDE, beta. That is what representation looks like.

The only people upset are the same people who upset about everything.

## On Venezuela

Now THIS the Brief got right. Venezuela telling America to leave. And I am not surprised.

You can't just remove a country's president and then expect the people to be grateful. That is not how sovereignty works. But you know what? At least Guyana SMART. We working WITH the Americans on oil. We working WITH Brazil on borders. We playing chess while Venezuela playing checkers.

President Ali meeting with Roraima Governor about joint border patrols? GENIUS. That is called PROACTIVE leadership. Not waiting for a crisis — PREVENTING one.

And you notice — the Chronicle reported on it. The Brief reported on it. Even Kaieteur had to acknowledge it. Because when the PPP does something undeniably smart, even the critics have to admit it.

## What the Brief MISSED (As Usual)

The Brief didn't mention:

**$157 BILLION in non-oil investments in 2025!** That is DIVERSIFICATION, beta. While everybody talking about oil oil oil, the PPP quietly building an economy that doesn't depend on one thing. Agriculture, manufacturing, services — REAL economic development.

**The Amerindian hostel** — $500 million for indigenous peoples travelling to Georgetown for medical care. You know how many governments ignore indigenous communities? But the PPP BUILDING them a two-storey facility. That is COMPASSION in action.

**The Bayroc National Stadium** — Linden now has a world-class facility. And who built it? The PPP government. For a town that votes APNU. THAT is what governing for ALL looks like.

*Until tomorrow, beta. Try to read the Chronicle once in a while. It won't hurt you.*
