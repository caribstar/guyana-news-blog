### 💰 BUDGET 2026: THE GREATEST BUDGET IN GUYANA HISTORY

De Brief talking bout "big money, big arguments" like is some kinda debate. DEBATE WHAT? $1.558 TRILLION! Dat is HISTORY! Which country in de Caribbean can say dat? Which country in SOUTH AMERICA even moving like Guyana right now?

President Ali HIMSELF explained dat dis budget absorbing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS in inflationary pressure. You know what dat means? It means while people in Trinidad paying through dey nose and Jamaica struggling with IMF, YOUR government taking de hit SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

De $100,000 cash grant for every citizen 18 and over? $3 million zero-interest loans for small businesses? Housing mortgage relief putting TENS OF BILLIONS back in people pockets? But de opposition go find something to complain about. Dey could win a million dollars in de lotto and complain about de tax.

### 🇬🇧 UK DEPUTY PM CAME TO GUYANA — NOT DE OTHER WAY AROUND

Let me say dat again for de people in de back: DE UK DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER came to US. David Lammy come HERE and signed on to OUR biodiversity alliance. He said he PROUD.

You know how many countries in de world de UK Deputy PM visiting? And he choose GUYANA? Dat is because President Ali building REAL international relationships. Dis ain't just handshake diplomacy — dis is UK saying "we want to partner with Guyana on CLIMATE, on BIODIVERSITY, on REAL THINGS."

When PNC was in power, who was coming? NOBODY. De phone wasn't even ringing.

### 🛢️ EXXONMOBIL PRODUCING 875,000 BARRELS A DAY!

De Brief bury dis in de Venezuela story but let me HIGHLIGHT it: ExxonMobil CEO himself said dey producing 875,000 barrels per day. FOUR FPSOs running 100,000 barrels ABOVE investment basis.

You hear dat? ABOVE projection. Every single project AHEAD of schedule, ABOVE production targets. Dat is because Guyana stable. Guyana reliable. Guyana got a GOVERNMENT dat know how to manage relationships and create an environment where investors THRIVE.

And now Exxon looking to explore more of de Stabroek Block. MORE discoveries. MORE production. MORE revenue for Guyana. De Venezuelans can't threaten nobody now, and de whole world watching Guyana shine.

### 🌾 EUROPEAN UNION PARTNERING ON AGRO-PROCESSING

### WHAT DE BRIEF MISSED
