## 4-MINUTE SCRIPT — Sunday Deep Dive

**[INTRO — 15 seconds]**

Good morning Guyana! Welcome to your Sunday deep dive. Big stories today — a newspaper is dying, a training college is born, and Trinidad is in full Carnival mode. Let's get into it.

**[SEGMENT 1 — Stabroek News — 90 seconds]**

The biggest story this weekend: Stabroek News, one of Guyana's oldest independent newspapers, announced it will cease operations on March 15 and begin voluntary liquidation. After 39 years of publication.

The de Caires family said the decision was extraordinarily difficult and painful. They cited the global collapse of print advertising — down 75 percent worldwide since 2004 — declining circulation, and a critical detail: the government owes them eighty-four point four million dollars in unpaid advertising from last year.

The government's response was basically that the closure reflects global media trends. Minister McCoy called it regrettable and talked about competitive market forces.

The Guyana Press Association called it a significant loss to the nation's media landscape and democratic fabric. And they're right — Stabroek was the first independent newspaper in post-independence Guyana.

This comes weeks after Trinidad's Newsday also shut down. Caribbean print media is in serious trouble.

**[SEGMENT 2 — GTTCI Opening — 60 seconds]**

On a more positive note, President Ali commissioned the Guyana Technical Training College in Port Mourant on Saturday. This is a US one-hundred-and-twenty-million-dollar facility designed to certify Guyanese workers for the oil and gas industry.

Thirty-five graduates have already gained employment offshore on the Unity FPSO. Minister Bharrat said this is about ensuring Guyanese get the certifications they need for well-paying technical jobs.

The President also announced a new state-of-the-art agricultural training facility will be built in Region Six to support the industrialisation of agriculture. Berbice is becoming a training hub.

**[SEGMENT 3 — Caribbean Roundup — 60 seconds]**

Around the Caribbean: Trinidad and Tobago is in full Carnival mode. J'ouvert started before dawn on Monday and the Parade of the Bands is tomorrow. Police have already confiscated an impressive collection of weapons.

In Barbados, Mia Mottley was sworn in for a historic third consecutive term. Her new cabinet took their oaths at CARIFESTA House today.

And West Indies are through to the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup after demolishing Nepal by nine wickets in Mumbai.

**[SEGMENT 4 — Uncle Ramesh Corner — 30 seconds]**

And of course Uncle Ramesh has his own take. He says everybody crying about Stabroek News while ignoring a twenty-billion-dollar training college, a healthcare partnership with religious institutions, and expanded land for small miners. His message: read the Chronicle, it'll make you feel better. Classic Ramesh.
