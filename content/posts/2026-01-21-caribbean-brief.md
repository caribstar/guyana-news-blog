## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $6.7 BILLION AND COUNTING

The IMF Executive Board approved US$415 million for Jamaica under its Rapid Financing Instrument's large natural disaster window. This brings the total international support package for Hurricane Melissa recovery to a whopping US$6.7 billion over three years.

**The Numbers:**
- **US$415 million** — IMF emergency assistance (approved Jan 16)
- **US$1 billion** — World Bank
- **US$1 billion** — Inter-American Development Bank
- **US$200 million** — Caribbean Development Bank
- **US$1 billion** — CAF Development Bank

**The Damage:** Hurricane Melissa (Category 5, October 28, 2025) killed at least 45 people and caused an estimated US$8.8 billion in damage.

**PM Holness' Take:** Called the support package "unprecedented."

**What's Next:** Jamaica is launching RE-LEAF, planting 300,000 seedlings between January and June 2026. Because nothing says "recovery" like seedlings.

Meanwhile, Caribbean Airlines announced it will suspend Puerto Rico and BVI routes in 2026 as part of its Barbados hub overhaul. Passengers affected: a lot.

## 🇻🇪 MADURO UPDATE: "I AM STILL PRESIDENT"

Two weeks after the U.S. military extracted Nicolas Maduro from Caracas in a Delta Force raid, the deposed Venezuelan leader continues his legal drama from Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.

**In Court (January 5):** Maduro told Judge Hellerstein: "I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country."

The judge cut him off.

**His Defense Strategy:** Attorney Barry Pollack is arguing that Maduro should have sovereign immunity as a head of state. The U.S. doesn't recognize him as president, so... good luck with that.

**Back in Caracas:** Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as acting president. She initially vowed to fight American aggression, then posted a statement inviting the U.S. to "collaborate" on an "agenda of cooperation."

**Trump's Response:** "We're in charge."

**The Charges:** Narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering. Could face life in prison.

**Next Hearing:** March 17.

## 🇭🇹 HAITI: TPS TERMINATED, CHAOS CONTINUES

**Meanwhile in Haiti:**
- Bishop Pierre-André Dumas has withdrawn from a proposed national mediation process
- The Transitional Presidential Council's immunity expires February 7
- Elections pushed to... eventually
- Carnival continues anyway

**The Travel Advisory:** Governments continue to warn against non-essential travel. Royal Caribbean has cancelled all 2026 visits to Labadee.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: NEW PM, NEW PROBLEMS
