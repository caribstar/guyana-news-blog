## 🔥 HOT PICKS THIS WEEK

### 1. RIVER CRUISE ADJACENT INVESTMENTS
Minister Rodrigues just toured the "One Freedom" cruise ship. You know what this means? RIVER TOURISM IS COMING.

**Patriot Play:** Any business near the Demerara River that could benefit from tourist foot traffic. Think about it — 46 rooms of tourists need:
- Food
- Souvenirs  
- Taxi services
- "Authentic Guyanese Experiences"

*Disclaimer: This is satire. We are not actual financial advisors. We just love Guyana.*

### 2. FIBRE OPTIC SERVICES
200 newly certified technicians entering the market. But you know what 200 technicians need?
- Tools
- Vehicles
- Uniforms
- Lunch

**Patriot Play:** The businesses that SERVICE the service providers. That's where the smart money goes.

### 3. HINTERLAND AIRSTRIP ADJACENT
Roraima Airways cutting fares 7% because of improved airstrips. More people flying = more economic activity in the hinterland.

**Patriot Play:** Lethem-adjacent anything. That border town about to BOOM.

## 📉 WHAT TO AVOID

### ❌ OPPOSITION LEADER FUTURES
Look, we not political analysts here at Patriots Portfolio, but we CAN read the room. Everyone — and we mean EVERYONE — saying don't elect someone under indictment.

If you was thinking about investing in anything tied to WIN's political future... maybe wait until Monday meeting and see how this plays out.

### ❌ TABATINGA CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE BETS
Four workers on site. $182 million project. We not touching that timeline prediction with a ten-foot pole.

## 💎 LONG-TERM PATRIOT HOLDS

**Gas-to-Energy:** Still on track for year-end. When that power plant comes online, electricity costs going DOWN and industrial capacity going UP. This is the generational play.

**Bayrock Stadium:** Opening January 31. Linden about to get a synthetic track, football field, and spectator stands. Regional sports development = regional economic development.

**China-Guyana Friendship Park:** Completing January 26. Family entertainment destination near the new bridge. Think about what businesses thrive near parks...

## 🎯 PATRIOTS PORTFOLIO WISDOM

*"A true patriot invests in Guyana's future. A smart patriot invests early."*

Remember: We're not licensed financial advisors. We're just extremely patriotic people who read the news and see opportunities everywhere.

The difference between you and a rich person? The rich person saw the opportunity BEFORE it was obvious.

Oil money flowing. Infrastructure building. Tourism expanding. Technical skills developing.

**The question isn't whether Guyana going up. The question is whether YOU going up with it.**
