Day of REST! Day of PEACE!\nAnd this youngin’ at The Brief write the LONGEST article yet and STILL managing to miss every single point!\nLet Uncle Ramesh break down where The Brief went wrong (AGAIN).\nEDS STRIKE BACK\" - BRIEF RUNNING OUT OF STAR WARS TITLES The Brief says: “The Mohameds Strike Back (The Musical)”\nUncle Ramesh says: This ain’t entertainment! This is DYSFUNCTION!\nWhat The Brief Focuses On: Mohameds filing appeals (yawn, we know!) Lawyer’s catchphrase Kaieteur’s 4,000+ articles What The Brief IGNORES: WHY the system allows infinite appeals WHO benefits from delays WHAT reforms needed Same Story, Different Day:\nThe Brief been writing about Mohameds since JANUARY 8! That’s 4 DAYS straight! Same complaints! Same jokes! NO NEW ANALYSIS!\nUncle Ramesh’s Question: If The Brief SO tired of Mohamed stories, WHY they keep writing the same thing over and over?!\nDO BETTER JOURNALISM!\nOES HIGHWAY PART 47: THE BRIEF CAN’T LET IT GO The Brief says: “25 months and needs repairs!”\nUncle Ramesh says: 25 months is TWO YEARS, child! Not 13 months!\nThe Brief on Thursday: “Highway lasted 13 months!”\nThe Brief on Sunday: “Highway lasted 25 months!”\nWHICH ONE IS IT?!\nLet Uncle Ramesh do the ACTUAL math:\nDecember 2023 to January 2026 = 25 months First complaints? March 2025 = 15 months So: Highway worked for 15 months BEFORE complaints, now at 25 months getting fix.\nThat’s Different From: “Lasted 13 months” or “falling apart immediately”\nThe REAL Story: Concrete highway uneven after a year (annoying). Government fixing with asphalt (reasonable). Government LYING about “always the plan” (dishonest).\nReport the TRUTH, not exaggerate for jokes!\nSTATS: THE BRIEF STILL CAN’T UNDERSTAND NUMBERS The Brief says: “More people died but crime is down? Pick your metric!”\nUncle Ramesh says: IT AIN’T “PICK YOUR METRIC”! They DIFFERENT METRICS!\nLet Uncle Ramesh explain AGAIN since The Brief ain’t listening:\nOverall Serious Crimes: DOWN 25.5% (Robberies, burglaries, larceny, assault, etc.)\nMurders: UP 11% (Specific category within overall crime)\nBOTH TRUE SIMULTANEOUSLY! Example: If robberies down from 500 to 250 (down 250 cases) And murders up from 120 to 134 (up 14 cases) OVERALL crime DOWN even though murders UP!\nThis Is Basic Math!\nThe Brief: “Government is lying!”\nUncle Ramesh: “You don’t understand statistics!”\nThe REAL Criticism: Government SHOULD say: “Overall crime down significantly, but we’re very concerned about murder increase and here’s our plan…”\nInstead they ONLY focus on positive numbers.\nBut The Brief ALSO Wrong: Acting like government LYING when they not! The numbers BOTH true!\nBOTH Government AND The Brief being dishonest!\nOnly Uncle Ramesh telling FULL truth!\nITION STILL MISSING\" - THE BRIEF BLIND AND DEAF The Brief says: “Where is the opposition? Seriously, where?”\nUncle Ramesh says: Open your EYES and EARS, child!\nThis Week Alone, Opposition:\nProtested third-country deportation deal Called out Mohamed case delays Questioned infrastructure spending Criticized government silence on Venezuela The Brief: “Where are they?”\nUncle Ramesh: RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!\nThe REAL Issue: Parliament can’t convene until Mohamed elected Opposition Leader. That’s DIFFERENT from “opposition missing!”\nThey THERE! They VOCAL! You just not PAYING ATTENTION!\nER GATE: THE BRIEF FINALLY ASK GOOD QUESTIONS! The Brief says: “Mohamed claims squatters on his land… conspiracy?”\nUncle Ramesh says: GOOD! Ask questions! Investigate!\nThis Is Actual Journalism:\nWho the squatters? Who tell them they could be there? Why police transferred? What the timeline? Uncle Ramesh Approves! âœ“\nSee? When The Brief INVESTIGATES instead of MOCKS, they do good work!\nMore of THIS! Less of “Star Wars” titles!\nâš¡ GPL CONTRACTORS: THE BRIEF REPEATING THEMSELVES The Brief says: “Contractors still threatening grid”\nUncle Ramesh says: You wrote this THURSDAY! And SATURDAY! Now SUNDAY!\nWE KNOW! Contractors dangerous! You told us THREE TIMES already!\nNew Information? None!\nNew Analysis? None!\nJust Repeating? Yes!\nThis Is Lazy Journalism!\nIf you gonna report same story multiple days, at LEAST add NEW information each time!\nHE BRIEF REALLY MISSED (COMPREHENSIVE LIST) 1. Mohamed System Reform: Been complaining for 4 days. ZERO suggestions for reform. Just complaints.\n2. Heroes Highway Context: Numbers keep changing! 13 months? 25 months? Get it straight!\n3. Crime Stats Literacy: Still don’t understand how overall crime and murder rates both true.\n4. Opposition Visibility: Literally blind to opposition actions. Need glasses?\n5. Infrastructure Positives: Aishalton working! Other projects progressing! Where that coverage?\n6. Repetitive Content: Same stories 3-4 days in a row with no new info!\nRAMESH’S SUNDAY SCORECARD The Brief This Week:\nThursday: 40% accurate (Venezuela take too jokey)\nFriday: 35% accurate (missing context everywhere)\nSaturday: 37.5% accurate (can’t do construction math)\nSunday: 30% accurate (repetitive + still can’t understand stats)\nWeekly Average: 35.6%\nThat’s an F, Brief! An F!\nHE BRIEF NEEDS TO DO BETTER 1. STOP REPEATING STORIES Mohamed story 4 days straight? ENOUGH!\n2. LEARN STATISTICS Both numbers can be true! Basic math!\n3. WATCH THE OPPOSITION They there! You not looking!\n4. GET FACTS STRAIGHT 13 months or 25 months? PICK ONE!\n5. BALANCE CRITICISM Some things working! Report those too!\n6. DO INVESTIGATION Squatter story good! More like that!\n7. STOP WITH MOVIE TITLES Star Wars references ain’t journalism!\nWORD FROM QUEENS Four days. Four editions. Same stories. Same jokes. Same misunderstandings.\nThe Brief Got Better At:\nAsking questions about squatters âœ“ Taking contractor safety serious âœ“ The Brief Still Bad At:\nUnderstanding statistics âœ— Tracking opposition âœ— Getting facts straight âœ— Not repeating themselves âœ— Balanced reporting âœ— Uncle Ramesh’s Advice: Take a BREAK! Do RESEARCH! Learn MATH! WATCH the opposition! And for God’s sake, STOP writing about Mohameds every single day unless you have NEW information!\nMessages for The Brief:\nOn Mohameds: We GET IT! Move on unless you got NEW info!\nOn Heroes Highway: Get your numbers straight! 13 or 25? DECIDE!\nOn Crime Stats: LEARN STATISTICS! I’m begging you!\nOn Opposition: OPEN YOUR EYES! They literally everywhere!\nOn Squatters: GOOD JOURNALISM! Keep investigating!\nOn GPL: You told us THREE TIMES! We heard you!\nOn Weekly Coverage: Too repetitive! Need MORE variety!\nMy wife calling me for Sunday lunch. At least THAT consistent, unlike The Brief’s facts!\nHappy Sunday, Guyana. Read The Brief for laughs, but come to Uncle Ramesh for TRUTH!\nâ€” Uncle Ramesh\nCalling from Queens, NY\nWhere we know repeating yourself ain’t journalism\nâ±ï¸ Uncle Ramesh Talk Time: 6 minutes\nâ˜• Coffee consumed: 3 cups (needed it for this one)\ns I corrected The Brief:** Too many to count\nf’s Weekly Grade:** F (35.6% average)\ntration level:** MAXIMUM\nStill love both Guyana AND The Brief:** Yes (somebody gotta!)\ncle Ramesh: Grading The Brief’s homework since 2026!\nShare this if you think The Brief needs to go back to journalism school!\n",

<p><strong>Same Story, Different Day:</strong></p>
<p>The Brief been writing about Mohameds since JANUARY 8! That&rsquo;s 4 DAYS straight! Same complaints! Same jokes! <strong>NO NEW ANALYSIS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh&rsquo;s Question:</strong>
If The Brief SO tired of Mohamed stories, WHY they keep writing the same thing over and over?!</p>
<p><strong>DO BETTER JOURNALISM!</strong></p>

<h2 id="oes-highway-part-47-the-brief-cant-let-it-go">OES HIGHWAY PART 47: THE BRIEF CAN&rsquo;T LET IT GO<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oes-highway-part-47-the-brief-cant-let-it-go">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;25 months and needs repairs!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> 25 months is TWO YEARS, child! Not 13 months!</p>
<p><strong>The Brief on Thursday:</strong> &ldquo;Highway lasted 13 months!&rdquo;<br>
<strong>The Brief on Sunday:</strong> &ldquo;Highway lasted 25 months!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>WHICH ONE IS IT?!</strong></p>
<p>Let Uncle Ramesh do the ACTUAL math:</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2023 to January 2026 = 25 months</li>
<li>First complaints? March 2025 = 15 months</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So:</strong> Highway worked for 15 months BEFORE complaints, now at 25 months getting fix.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s Different From:</strong>
&ldquo;Lasted 13 months&rdquo; or &ldquo;falling apart immediately&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The REAL Story:</strong>
Concrete highway uneven after a year (annoying). Government fixing with asphalt (reasonable). Government LYING about &ldquo;always the plan&rdquo; (dishonest).</p>
<p><strong>Report the TRUTH, not exaggerate for jokes!</strong></p>

<h2 id="stats-the-brief-still-cant-understand-numbers">STATS: THE BRIEF STILL CAN&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND NUMBERS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stats-the-brief-still-cant-understand-numbers">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;More people died but crime is down? Pick your metric!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> IT AIN&rsquo;T &ldquo;PICK YOUR METRIC&rdquo;! They DIFFERENT METRICS!</p>
<p>Let Uncle Ramesh explain AGAIN since The Brief ain&rsquo;t listening:</p>
<h3 id="overall-serious-crimes-down-255"><strong>Overall Serious Crimes:</strong> DOWN 25.5%<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#overall-serious-crimes-down-255">#</a></h3>
<p>(Robberies, burglaries, larceny, assault, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="murders-up-11"><strong>Murders:</strong> UP 11%<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#murders-up-11">#</a></h3>
<p>(Specific category within overall crime)</p>
<h3 id="both-true-simultaneously"><strong>BOTH TRUE SIMULTANEOUSLY!</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#both-true-simultaneously">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
If robberies down from 500 to 250 (down 250 cases)
And murders up from 120 to 134 (up 14 cases)
OVERALL crime DOWN even though murders UP!</p>
<p><strong>This Is Basic Math!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brief:</strong> &ldquo;Government is lying!&rdquo;<br>
<strong>Uncle Ramesh:</strong> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand statistics!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The REAL Criticism:</strong>
Government SHOULD say: &ldquo;Overall crime down significantly, but we&rsquo;re very concerned about murder increase and here&rsquo;s our plan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead they ONLY focus on positive numbers.</p>
<p><strong>But The Brief ALSO Wrong:</strong>
Acting like government LYING when they not! The numbers BOTH true!</p>
<p><strong>BOTH Government AND The Brief being dishonest!</strong></p>
<p>Only Uncle Ramesh telling FULL truth!</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Where is the opposition? Seriously, where?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> Open your EYES and EARS, child!</p>
<p><strong>This Week Alone, Opposition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protested third-country deportation deal</li>
<li>Called out Mohamed case delays</li>
<li>Questioned infrastructure spending</li>
<li>Criticized government silence on Venezuela</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Brief:</strong> &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh:</strong> RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!</p>
<p><strong>The REAL Issue:</strong>
Parliament can&rsquo;t convene until Mohamed elected Opposition Leader. That&rsquo;s DIFFERENT from &ldquo;opposition missing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They THERE! They VOCAL! You just not PAYING ATTENTION!</p>

<h2 id="er-gate-the-brief-finally-ask-good-questions">ER GATE: THE BRIEF FINALLY ASK GOOD QUESTIONS!<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#er-gate-the-brief-finally-ask-good-questions">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Mohamed claims squatters on his land&hellip; conspiracy?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> GOOD! Ask questions! Investigate!</p>
<p><strong>This Is Actual Journalism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who the squatters?</li>
<li>Who tell them they could be there?</li>
<li>Why police transferred?</li>
<li>What the timeline?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh Approves!</strong> âœ“</p>
<p>See? When The Brief INVESTIGATES instead of MOCKS, they do good work!</p>
<p>More of THIS! Less of &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; titles!</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Contractors still threatening grid&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> You wrote this THURSDAY! And SATURDAY! Now SUNDAY!</p>
<p><strong>WE KNOW!</strong> Contractors dangerous! You told us THREE TIMES already!</p>
<p><strong>New Information?</strong> None!<br>
<strong>New Analysis?</strong> None!<br>
<strong>Just Repeating?</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>This Is Lazy Journalism!</strong></p>
<p>If you gonna report same story multiple days, at LEAST add NEW information each time!</p>

<p><strong>The Brief Got Better At:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions about squatters âœ“</li>
<li>Taking contractor safety serious âœ“</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Brief Still Bad At:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding statistics âœ—</li>
<li>Tracking opposition âœ—</li>
<li>Getting facts straight âœ—</li>
<li>Not repeating themselves âœ—</li>
<li>Balanced reporting âœ—</li>

<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh&rsquo;s Advice:</strong>
Take a BREAK! Do RESEARCH! Learn MATH! WATCH the opposition! And for God&rsquo;s sake, STOP writing about Mohameds every single day unless you have NEW information!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Messages for The Brief:</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Mohameds:</strong>
We GET IT! Move on unless you got NEW info!</p>
<p><strong>On Heroes Highway:</strong>
Get your numbers straight! 13 or 25? DECIDE!</p>
<p><strong>On Crime Stats:</strong>
LEARN STATISTICS! I&rsquo;m begging you!</p>
<p><strong>On Opposition:</strong>
OPEN YOUR EYES! They literally everywhere!</p>
