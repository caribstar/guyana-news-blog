## Barbados: Election Day

Barbados went to the polls on Tuesday in snap elections called by Prime Minister Mia Mottley. Pre-election polling showed the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) leading in all 30 constituencies with approximately 78% voter support. The DLP leader reportedly did not vote in his own constituency's elections — which tells you everything about the state of the opposition.

Reports from across the island described voting as "smooth and steady." The BLP manifesto focused on childcare, jobs, and development. Mottley has pledged 100% renewable energy for Barbados by 2030 under her Mission 2030 initiative. Results are expected shortly if not already declared.

Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey deployed observers to monitor the election. Barbados recorded its busiest year at Grantley Adams Airport in 2025 with 2.4 million passengers — so the economy is at least generating tourist traffic even if political competition is thin.

## Trinidad: "Gold Standard" Of Energy

Trinidad and Tobago's Energy Minister Dr. Roodal Moonilal says international oil companies now describe T&T as the "gold standard" for doing business efficiently in the energy sector. Speaking at a post-Cabinet press conference, Moonilal confirmed T&T's participation in the upcoming Guyana Energy Conference scheduled for February 17-20.

Caribbean Energy Week 2026 is drawing multi-billion-dollar investment discussions. The Prime Minister is expected to address the conference amid what organisers describe as an "investment surge" in regional energy.

## Cuba: Airlines Can't Refuel

Cuba has told airlines they can no longer refuel on the island as the country's fuel crisis deepens. This follows the four-day work week Cuba imposed due to severe energy shortages. When your country is so short on fuel that planes cannot fill up before leaving, you have passed the crisis stage and entered the emergency stage.

## Jamaica: Agriculture Milestone

Jamaica officially launched a major agriculture transformation project in St. Elizabeth parish, marking what the government calls a significant milestone in the sector. Separately, Jamaica's Under-17 football team maintained their perfect start in World Cup qualifiers with a 12-0 demolition of the Cayman Islands.

## St. Vincent: Taiwan Donates US$3 Million

Taiwan has donated US$3 million to support social relief programmes in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The Taiwan-Caribbean diplomatic relationship continues to deliver tangible aid, even as geopolitical pressures mount on smaller nations to reconsider their recognition of Taipei.

## Regional Health

Chikungunya cases are increasing across several Caribbean and Latin American countries, with health authorities urging mosquito prevention measures. Carnival season across the region means large outdoor gatherings — and plenty of standing water in discarded cups.
