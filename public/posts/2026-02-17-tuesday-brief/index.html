Reading the news so you can laugh, cry, and argue at the same time.</em></p><hr><h2 id=-opposition-leader-arrested-for-being-late>⚖️ OPPOSITION LEADER ARRESTED&mldr; FOR BEING LATE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-opposition-leader-arrested-for-being-late>#</a></h2><p><strong>Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s how Monday went for Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed:</p><ul><li><strong>9:00 AM</strong> — Court called his name. He wasn&rsquo;t there.</li><li><strong>9:05 AM</strong> — Magistrate Judy Latchman issued an arrest warrant. Five minutes. That&rsquo;s faster than most people decide what to eat for breakfast.</li><li><strong>9:35 AM</strong> — Mohamed finally arrived. Was promptly handcuffed and escorted to the lock-ups.</li></ul><p>Mohamed blamed the PPP/C, claiming the government &ldquo;orchestrated events&rdquo; to delay his arrival. The government has not commented, presumably because they were too busy not holding press conferences.</p><p>The magistrate eventually withdrew the warrant, telling Mohamed: &ldquo;I will temper justice with mercy.&rdquo; Which is judicial language for: &ldquo;Boy, don&rsquo;t try this again.&rdquo;</p><p>The extradition case — a 25-page federal indictment from Miami alleging gold export fraud, money laundering, bribery, and millions in evaded taxes — was adjourned to February 18.</p><p>His father, Nazar Mohamed, remains unwell.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Mohamed&rsquo;s Monday</th><th>Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Court starts</td><td>9:00 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Warrant issued</td><td>9:05 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Mohamed arrives</td><td>9:35 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Handcuffed</td><td>9:36 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Warrant withdrawn</td><td>~10:00 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Next hearing</td><td>Feb 18</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Five minutes. That&rsquo;s the grace period between &ldquo;respected member of parliament&rdquo; and &ldquo;take him to the lock-ups.&rdquo; Imagine if Georgetown minibuses ran on this schedule.</p><hr><h2 id=-ncn-cameraman-brought-a-gun-to-court>🔫 NCN CAMERAMAN BROUGHT A GUN TO COURT<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-ncn-cameraman-brought-a-gun-to-court>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Kaieteur News</strong></p><p>If the Mohamed arrest wasn&rsquo;t enough drama for one courthouse, an NCN cameraman was arrested at the same Georgetown Magistrates&rsquo; Court after someone noticed he was carrying what appeared to be a firearm in his waistband.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting:</p><ul><li>The cameraman had only been at NCN for a few months</li><li>He was <strong>not originally scheduled</strong> to cover Monday&rsquo;s proceedings</li><li>He was reportedly <strong>instructed by a senior government official</strong> to cover the Mohamed extradition case</li></ul><p>Let that marinate.</p><p>A government media employee, freshly hired, sent specifically to cover the opposition leader&rsquo;s court appearance, shows up with a weapon. Whether it was a real firearm or a replica remains under investigation, but the optics are absolutely terrible no matter how you slice it.</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Nobody brings a gun to court by accident. They do it on purpose or because they forgot they had one — and honestly, we&rsquo;re not sure which answer is worse.</p><hr><h2 id=-stabroek-news-a-nation-in-mourning>💔 STABROEK NEWS: A NATION IN MOURNING<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-stabroek-news-a-nation-in-mourning>#</a></h2><p><strong>Sources: Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, Chronicle</strong></p><p>Today&rsquo;s Stabroek News letters page is essentially an obituary section for itself. The paper is closing March 15, and the outpouring is overwhelming:</p><ul><li><strong>Georgetown Mayor</strong> called the closure &ldquo;a profound loss to our society&rdquo; and noted the paper was repeatedly denied a radio licence</li><li><strong>Former journalists</strong> described it as &ldquo;the newspaper of record&rdquo; and praised editor Anand Persaud&rsquo;s work ethic</li><li>One letter compared the government&rsquo;s treatment: billions to bail out GuySuCo, but can&rsquo;t ensure an independent newspaper survives. &ldquo;All Stabroek News needs is honest and equal treatment.&rdquo;</li><li>Another writer noted the &ldquo;perverse timing&rdquo; — announcing closure on Friday the 13th, final edition on the Ides of March</li></ul><p>The letters page today reads like a combination funeral, protest rally, and love letter. And through it all, Stabroek News is still publishing — still asking questions, still giving voice to the voiceless, right up to the last page.</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> A country with a $1.558 trillion budget and the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economy is losing its newspaper of record. Let that contradiction sit with you.</p><hr><h2 id=-energy-conference-opens--tri-star-port-launches>🛢️ ENERGY CONFERENCE OPENS — TRI-STAR PORT LAUNCHES<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-energy-conference-opens--tri-star-port-launches>#</a></h2><p><strong>Sources: Stabroek News, Chronicle</strong></p><p>The fifth Guyana Energy Conference and Supply Chain Expo opens TODAY at the Marriott Hotel, running February 17-20 under the theme &ldquo;Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Future Today.&rdquo;</p><p>The big announcement: Tri-Star port, pioneered by US-based Guyanese Kris Persaud, will be officially launched.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Ali used his weekend commissioning of the $20 billion Guyana Technical Training College at Port Mourant to lay out his vision:</p><ul><li>Deep-water port decisions coming before end of Q1</li><li>Phase 2 gas decisions coming before end of Q1</li><li>Brazil&rsquo;s Roraima governor bringing a delegation to discuss transshipment</li><li>Guyana positioned as &ldquo;logistics gateway&rdquo; for northern Brazil</li><li>Everything must be on point by 2030</li></ul><p>Ali also took shots at the opposition&rsquo;s budget critiques: &ldquo;The type of simplistic narrative shows an immense lack of understanding of how national development takes place.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Say what you want about Ali — the man has a vision. Whether the execution matches the PowerPoint remains the country&rsquo;s billion-dollar question. Literally.</p><hr><h2 id=-hakeem-olajuwon-wants-to-sell-you-a-condo>🏢 HAKEEM OLAJUWON WANTS TO SELL YOU A CONDO<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-hakeem-olajuwon-wants-to-sell-you-a-condo>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Chronicle</strong></p><p>NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem &ldquo;The Dream&rdquo; Olajuwon is co-developing TAJ Dream Ogle with Coastal Rim Properties. The deal:</p><ul><li>Units starting at US$250,000</li><li><strong>US$100,000 discount</strong> for all Guyanese citizens (local and diaspora) in the first 60 days</li><li>That brings the entry price down to US$150,000</li></ul><p>Minister of Tourism Susan Rodrigues called it &ldquo;exactly the private sector leadership we need.&rdquo;</p><p>Olajuwon praised Guyana&rsquo;s &ldquo;stable, investor-friendly climate&rdquo; and &ldquo;measurable improvements in public safety metrics.&rdquo;</p><table><thead><tr><th>TAJ Dream Ogle</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>US$250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Guyanese discount</td><td>US$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Discounted price</td><td>US$150,000</td></tr><tr><td>Discount window</td><td>60 days</td></tr><tr><td>Co-Developer</td><td>Hakeem Olajuwon</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> US$150,000 for a condo in Ogle. The average Guyanese monthly salary is roughly GY$80,000 (about US$380). You&rsquo;d need to save every dollar for 32 years. But hey — Hakeem believes in the dream, and dreams don&rsquo;t come with mortgage calculators.</p><hr><h2 id=-ali-orders-6-week-health-blitz>🏥 ALI ORDERS 6-WEEK HEALTH BLITZ<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-ali-orders-6-week-health-blitz>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Chronicle</strong></p><p>President Ali has directed the Health Ministry to launch a nationwide public health campaign within six weeks to tackle chronic diseases. He wants flyers, programmes, and partnerships with religious and community leaders to reach every citizen.</p><p>Ali also announced a new level-five teaching hospital in New Amsterdam that will serve as a regional cardiac and research centre — &ldquo;a hospital that will specialise in research and cardiac services, a cardiac centre for the whole region.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Vishwa Mahadeo defended telemedicine during budget debate:</p><ul><li>4 sites in 2022 → <strong>130 sites</strong> by end of February 2026</li><li>Target: <strong>150 sites</strong> by year-end</li><li>15,000 people accessed telemedicine-equipped facilities last year</li><li>6,363 patients used the system</li><li>1,293 video consultations conducted</li></ul><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Telemedicine went from 4 sites to 130 in four years. That&rsquo;s legitimately impressive. Now if we could apply that same growth rate to water treatment, we&rsquo;d really be cooking.</p><hr><h2 id=-new-airports-for-lethem-and-rose-hall>✈️ NEW AIRPORTS FOR LETHEM AND ROSE HALL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-new-airports-for-lethem-and-rose-hall>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Chronicle</strong></p><p>Government has issued Requests for Proposals for two new municipal airports:</p><ul><li><strong>Lethem</strong> (Region 9): Code 4E airport supporting larger aircraft, connecting Guyana to Brazil</li><li><strong>Rose Hall</strong> (Region 6): Improving domestic travel and commerce</li></ul><p>Both will be built under an EPC+F model (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Finance), meaning private investors will help finance the projects.</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> Lethem getting a real airport could transform the Rupununi. Rose Hall getting one means the Berbice diaspora might actually visit more. Both are overdue.</p><hr><h2 id=-2020-elections-trial-resumes>⚖️ 2020 ELECTIONS TRIAL RESUMES<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-2020-elections-trial-resumes>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Chronicle</strong></p><p>The trial over alleged irregularities during the March 2020 elections resumed Monday after a two-month break. PPP/C agent Sasenarine Singh testified about the infamous moment when Region 4 Returning Officer Clairmont Mingo was &ldquo;taken out on a stretcher.&rdquo;</p><p>Six years later, we&rsquo;re still in court over this. The trial continues under case-management guidelines.</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> 2020 was SIX years ago. At this rate, they&rsquo;ll finish the trial just in time for the next election.</p><hr><h2 id=-traffic-crackdown-3257-violations-in-one-week>🚗 TRAFFIC CRACKDOWN: 3,257 VIOLATIONS IN ONE WEEK<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-traffic-crackdown-3257-violations-in-one-week>#</a></h2><p><strong>Source: Chronicle</strong></p><p>The Traffic Department reported a staggering 3,257 violations for February 8-14:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Offence</th><th>Cases</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Speeding</td><td>1,161</td></tr><tr><td>Seatbelt violations</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>No helmet (rider)</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles in dangerous positions</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Unlicenced drivers</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>No helmet (pillion)</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Rear lights</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Front lights</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>DUI</td><td>29</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> 1,161 speeding cases in one week.

Iran&rsquo;s Foreign Minister says he has &ldquo;real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal.&rdquo; Trump says he&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;indirectly involved.&rdquo; Two aircraft carriers deployed to the Middle East. Iran is running military drills in the Strait of Hormuz. <strong>BREAKING:</strong> Iran says an understanding on &ldquo;main principles&rdquo; has been reached.</p><p><strong>Caribbean Drug Boat Strikes:</strong> US military struck another vessel Friday, killing 3. Death toll now at 133 killed in 38+ strikes since September. Barbados FM expressed concern the strikes &ldquo;may have bypassed due process.&rdquo; US hasn&rsquo;t provided evidence for most strikes.</p><p><strong>Russia-Ukraine:</strong> US hosting envoy talks in Geneva Tuesday-Wednesday, days before the 4th anniversary of Russia&rsquo;s invasion.</p><hr><h2 id=-kaieteurs-corner>📊 KAIETEUR&rsquo;S CORNER<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-kaieteurs-corner>#</a></h2><p>Kaieteur ran an editorial blasting Ali for governing via Facebook Live instead of press conferences. Key quote from the editorial: the President is &ldquo;acting as his own chief propagandist, speaking at the public rather than answering to it.&rdquo;</p><p>They also called the proposed Manpower Agency redundant given the existing ministry function, and ran a letter calling the 2026 budget &ldquo;a vision — but for whom?&rdquo; arguing it serves the private sector, not ordinary Guyanese.</p><p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Take:</strong> When your President prefers Facebook Live to press conferences, and your newspaper of record is closing, it&rsquo;s worth asking: who&rsquo;s left to ask the uncomfortable questions?</p><hr><h2 id=-todays-score>📈 TODAY&rsquo;S SCORE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-todays-score>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Paper</th><th>Good News</th><th>Bad News</th><th>Bizarre</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chronicle</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Stabroek</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Kaieteur</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Times</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Mood of the Nation:</strong> Mourning Stabroek News, confused about the cameraman with the gun, impressed by Hakeem Olajuwon&rsquo;s cameo, and deeply skeptical that anyone can afford a US$150K condo.</p><hr><p><em>That&rsquo;s your Tuesday Brief.
