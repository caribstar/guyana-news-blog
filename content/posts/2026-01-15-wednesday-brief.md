## 🌎 Guyanese Leads Regional Agriculture Body

**Big News:** Muhammad Ibrahim officially takes over as Director-General of the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) today, January 15. The Guyanese agronomist now heads this crucial regional agricultural cooperation body, marking another international leadership role for Guyana.

**Why It Matters:** As Guyana expands its agricultural sector beyond oil, having a Guyanese national leading regional agricultural policy could benefit the country's diversification efforts.

## 📊 Census Data Sparks Housing Debate

**The Numbers Don't Add Up:** Critics are using the newly released 2022 Census data to challenge the government's "housing crisis" narrative. Between 2012 and 2022:
- Population grew by 17.6%
- Households expanded by 32.9%
- Building stock surged by 42%

**The Argument:** The country added 92,233 new structures while the population grew by 131,719 people. Those buildings could accommodate nearly 300,000 people—more than twice the actual population increase.

**Infrastructure Reality Check:**
- National electricity demand hit 221 MW, straining GPL
- Wales Gas-to-Energy project delayed until late 2026
- Thousands of allocated house lots lack power, water, or road access

**The Conclusion:** Critics say this reveals "overbuilding and a planning crisis," not a housing shortage. Government spending continues on roads and preparatory works that deliver minimal functional improvement.

## ⚖️ Law Year Opens with Harsh Words

**AG Goes Off:** Attorney General Anil Nandlall used the opening of Law Year 2026 to blast magistrates' courts for failing to apply modern legislation. He didn't hold back on criticizing the failure to implement key laws already on the books.

**Acting Chancellor Responds:** Roxane George called for honoring constitutional provisions addressing the financial autonomy of the judiciary. Translation: Give us our money and independence.

**The Pattern:** This continues a trend of public finger-pointing between the executive and judiciary rather than quiet reform.

---

## 🔒 Cybercrime Law Under Fire

**Selective Enforcement Alleged:** The arrest of Stanley Basdeo under the Cybercrime Act has sparked accusations of politically motivated prosecution. Critics note:
- Basdeo criticized government over gun license denial
- Pro-government social media figures using "vulgarity, racial invective, and wild accusations" face no charges
- The law appears to target government critics while ignoring supporters

**The Warning:** "In every autocratic society, loyalty is temporary and usefulness is transactional. Those applauding state overreach today may soon find themselves the next target."

**What's at Stake:** Critics say Guyana is witnessing "the erosion of free speech through fear, and the normalization of repression through law."

## 🤐 President Silent on Migrant Deal

**No Comment:** President Ali refused to provide details on the arrangement with the US for Guyana to accept third-country nationals, telling reporters to refer to a Foreign Secretary statement that doesn't actually exist.

**What We Know:** Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud previously said the governments are "nearing an agreement" for Guyana to receive refugees or non-felons, with Georgetown having the right to refuse.

**The Problem:** Major policy decisions affecting the country's demographics and resources being made with minimal public disclosure or consultation.

## 📉 Criminal Court Backlog Easing

**Good News (Sort Of):** The January 2026 Demerara Criminal Assizes will hear 126 cases between January and March—a significant reduction from previous years' backlogs.

**The Reality:** Among the cases scheduled: the 2012 schoolboy murder, Shonette Dover case, and scores of rape charges. Justice delayed is justice denied, even if the delay is getting shorter.

---

## 🏛️ Parliament Still Paralyzed

**Still Waiting:** The 13th Parliament has met only once since November 3rd. No Leader of the Opposition has been elected. The 2026 budget must be presented, debated, and passed—but how?

**International Pressure:** EU Ambassador Luca Pierantoni and British High Commissioner Jane Miller are now publicly calling for Parliament to resume and the LOO to be elected "without delay."

**The Irony:** Both diplomats sat through a 2.5-hour presidential address to an empty opposition bench without objection. Now they're calling for democratic norms.

---

## 🛩️ Airfare Reductions Continue

**Good News for Hinterland:** Trans Guyana Airways announced a 7% reduction in airfares to all rehabilitated hinterland airstrips, following similar moves by other carriers. Roraima Airways also announced reductions.

**The Pattern:** As infrastructure improves, costs are coming down—showing what happens when you actually complete projects rather than just announce them.

---

## The Bottom Line

Today's news highlights a troubling pattern: infrastructure overbuilt without supporting utilities, laws selectively enforced against critics, and major policy decisions made behind closed doors. Meanwhile, international voices are finally speaking up about Parliament's dysfunction—after sitting silently through its initial sidelining.

The census data is particularly damning: if you're building houses faster than your population is growing, and faster than your utilities can support, you're not solving a housing crisis. You're creating an infrastructure crisis while burning through public funds.

**Tomorrow's Watch:** Will Parliament actually reconvene? Will anyone explain the third-country nationals deal? Will the courts address the cybercrime law's selective enforcement?

**Reading the Other Side:** Some will argue the census shows visionary planning, that financial reforms will materialize, and that the cybercrime law is working as intended. Read Uncle Ramesh's take for that perspective.

Stay skeptical, Guyana. 🇬🇾
