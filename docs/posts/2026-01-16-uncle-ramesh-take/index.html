Let Uncle Ramesh give ayuh de REAL story, not this opposition propaganda.\n🛢️ THE OIL “CRISIS” THAT ISN’T De Headline: “Oil wells running dry! Disaster!”\nDe Reality: We producing MORE oil than ever and making BILLIONS!\nAyuh remember when Guyana had ZERO oil? Now we pumping hundreds of thousands of barrels per day and suddenly dat is a problem?\nLet Me Break It Down:\n“They draining it too fast!”\n→ No man, they producing EFFICIENTLY! Would you rather wait 30 years to get de money when we need it NOW? Roads don’t build themselves!\n“75% goes to costs!”\n→ That’s called INVESTMENT! Exxon spent BILLIONS to find and extract dat oil. You think they should do it for free? These journalists never run a business.\n“No ring-fencing!”\n→ Flexibility is GOOD for business! When you got multiple fields, it make sense to manage costs across all of them. This is basic economics these Opposition people don’t understand.\n✈️ SPEAKER NADIR IN INDIA - REPRESENTING GUYANA! De same people complaining he left are de ones who would complain if Guyana wasn’t represented at international parliamentary conferences!\nDe Facts:\nHe meeting with UK House of Lords He meeting with UK Speaker He meeting with India’s Lok Sabha Speaker He REPRESENTING Guyana on de world stage! But nooo, according to Kaieteur News, he should just sit in Georgetown and wait for de Opposition to stop playing games and choose their leader already!\nReal Talk: How long Opposition need to pick ONE person? They been squabbling since September! That’s not de Speaker’s fault!\n🗳️ THE PARLIAMENT “CRISIS” De Opposition Story: Democracy is dead! Parliament closed! Dictatorship!\nDe Reality: Opposition can’t agree on their own leader for MONTHS, then blame de government!\nThink About It:\nSeptember 2024: Elections done January 2026: Still no Opposition Leader Whose fault is that? Not de government! You can’t show up to Parliament without a leader and then complain Parliament isn’t sitting. That’s like showing up to work without your ID and complaining security won’t let you in!\nDe Government is WORKING:\nBuilding roads Opening schools Attracting investment Creating jobs Meanwhile Opposition busy arguing about who should be leader while complaining nothing getting done. Irony much?\n🇫🇷 THESE FOREIGN AMBASSADORS With all due respect to de French and EU ambassadors, they should worry about THEIR countries’ problems first!\nFrance got:\nPension protests Strikes everywhere Immigration issues EU got:\nEconomic problems Political divisions Energy crisis But they got time to lecture GUYANA about Parliament? Please!\nUncle Ramesh Say: We appreciate your investment and partnership, but we can manage our own democracy, thank you very much! We been independent since 1966!\n🎭 MASHRAMANI - CELEBRATING SUCCESS! You know why we can afford Mashramani 2026? Because we got OIL MONEY!\nDe Opposition: “How can they party when Parliament closed?”\nUncle Ramesh: How can you complain about celebrating our culture and unity? Mashramani brings people together! It creates jobs! It showcases Guyana to de world!\nDe Facts:\nTourism revenue Local artists earning Small businesses selling National unity celebrating But according to these critics, we should sit home and cry because Opposition can’t pick a leader? Nah man!\n🗺️ PRESIDENT ALI ON VENEZUELA De Opposition: “He always lying! We can’t trust him!”\nUncle Ramesh: Ayuh remember when President Ali stood up to Venezuela referendum? When he went to de UN? When he rallied CARICOM support?\nShort Memory These Critics Have!\nYes, we should hold leaders accountable. But this automatic disbelief of EVERYTHING is just Opposition politics. De man said no deal with US on Venezuela. Take him at his word unless proven otherwise!\n🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRESS While Kaieteur News busy writing about imaginary crises, REAL WORK happening:\nThis Week Alone:\nBuzz Bee Dam four-lane construction Special needs school opened (UAE partnership!) Thomas Lands Road reopened Pump station contracts awarded Solar power plant for CJIA But De Brief Sees: “Theater! Distraction!”\nUncle Ramesh Sees: PROGRESS!\nYou can’t build roads, schools, and infrastructure in countries where oil wells “running dry” and democracy “dead.” Use your common sense!\n💰 THE REAL NUMBERS Let Uncle Ramesh give ayuh de numbers they DON’T want to talk about:\nSince Oil Production Started:\nGDP growth: HIGHEST in region Foreign reserves: BILLIONS more Infrastructure investment: UNPRECEDENTED Job creation: THOUSANDS Cash grants: DELIVERED If Oil Deal So Bad:\nHow we doing better than EVERY Caribbean country? How we attracting BILLIONS in investment? How roads getting built EVERYWHERE?\nDe Truth: De 2016 contract wasn’t perfect, but it getting RESULTS. And we learning for future contracts. That’s called PROGRESS!\n📊 DRUG BUSTS - LAW WORKING This Week:\n$1M marijuana farm destroyed 50 lbs cocaine seized De Brief: Crime continues!\nUncle Ramesh: Police WORKING! They catching criminals! That’s what supposed to happen!\nYou think in countries with “dead democracy,” police busy catching drugs and building cases? Use logic!\n🎯 UNCLE RAMESH’S BOTTOM LINE What Really Happening:\nGuyana producing record oil and making billions for development. Critics want us to slow down and stay poor longer.\nSpeaker representing Guyana at international conferences while Opposition still can’t pick a leader after 4+ months.\nForeign ambassadors commenting but Guyana handling its own democracy just fine, thank you.\nMashramani launching because successful countries can celebrate AND work.\nInfrastructure getting built while critics write fiction about “theater.”\n💭 REAL TALK FROM QUEENS You know what Uncle Ramesh see from up here in de diaspora?\nI see Guyana RISING. I see investment pouring in. I see relatives back home getting jobs, building houses, buying cars, sending their children to university.\nI see a country that was BROKE 10 years ago now talking about managing BILLIONS in oil revenue.\nIs everything perfect? No. Will there be bumps? Yes. Should we hold government accountable? ABSOLUTELY.\nBut this constant negativity, this automatic rejection of every success, this opposition propaganda disguised as journalism—it getting OLD.\n🇬🇾 DE TRUTH If you living in diaspora like Uncle Ramesh, you know de difference between propaganda and progress. You’ve seen countries with REAL problems. You’ve seen what actual economic collapse looks like.\nGuyana today: Growing economy, developing infrastructure, attracting investment, creating opportunities.\nGuyana according to de Brief: Disaster! Crisis! Everything terrible!\nUncle Ramesh Choose: Reality over rhetoric.\nTomorrow: More progress while critics write about imaginary problems! 🎯\nRemember: Don’t let pessimism blind you to REAL progress happening every day!\nStay proud, stay informed, stay GUYANESE! 🇬🇾\nUncle Ramesh writes from Queens, New York, where he reads ALL FOUR newspapers daily and gives you de balanced view ayuh not getting from de Opposition propaganda machine!\n","wordCount":"1138","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-01-16T09:00:00-04:00","dateModified":"2026-01-16T09:00:00-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Uncle Ramesh"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-16-uncle-ramesh-take/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Uncle Ramesh: Why All This Oil Drama Is Just Opposition Noise</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-16 09:00:00 -0400 -0400'>January 16, 2026</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Uncle Ramesh</div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=-uncle-rameshs-take->🇬🇾 UNCLE RAMESH&rsquo;S TAKE 🇬🇾<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-uncle-rameshs-take->#</a></h1><p><strong>Straight Talk from Queens to Georgetown</strong></p><hr><p>Greetings from New York, where is cold but not as cold as some people hearts when it come to seeing Guyana succeed! 🌎</p><p>Lawd, ayuh hear de noise today?
