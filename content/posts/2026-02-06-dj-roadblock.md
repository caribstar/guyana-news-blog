## 🚗 DEM BOYS SEH IT BEST: "MORE ROAD, MORE TRAFFIC"

Aye, Dem Boys from Kaieteur drop the science today and DJ Roadblock has to give them a big up! They said: "De more road yuh build, de more traffic yuh get. Is like hunger — de more yuh cook, de more people turn up with spoon."

TRUTH! 🎯

They compared road widening to "buying bigger pants instead of going on a diet." Today four lanes, tomorrow six lanes, next week we paving people's yard. This is the REALEST traffic analysis anyone has done in this country. Forget the consultants, forget the engineers — Dem Boys just solved the puzzle in two paragraphs.

## 🔴 FRIDAY TRAFFIC HOTSPOTS

### ECCLES ROUNDABOUT — THE EVENT HORIZON
**Status:** 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL

Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. The Eccles Roundabout has officially become a black hole. Scientists are studying it. NASA called. They said even the Mars Rover moves faster. If you entered the roundabout at 7:00 AM, you might exit by the time the budget debate finishes. And that could be NEXT WEEK.

### EAST BANK DEMERARA — THE CORRIDOR OF TEARS
**Status:** 🔴🔴🔴🔴 SEVERE

The four-lane highway that was supposed to solve everything has solved absolutely nothing. All it did was give more people the confidence to drive, which means MORE cars on MORE lanes creating the SAME traffic. Dem Boys was right — bigger pants, same belly.

### DEMERARA HARBOUR BRIDGE — PROCEED WITH CAUTION
**Status:** 🟡🟡🟡 MODERATE

After the truck crash incident, everybody driving extra careful on the bridge. Which is good for safety but terrible for speed. The man who caused the crash was driving without a licence, without insurance, with a faulty truck, and an improperly packed load. At this point the bridge has seen more drama than Parliament.

### SHERIFF STREET TO UG ROAD — THE DAILY MARATHON
**Status:** 🔴🔴🔴🔴 SEVERE

School traffic plus work traffic plus market traffic plus random construction traffic equals PURE CHAOS. Children sleeping in backseat, mother vex, father vexer, everybody late. Olympic-level preparation just to reach work before the boss start watching clock like CCTV.

### MANDELA AVENUE — THE SURVIVAL COURSE
**Status:** 🟡🟡🟡 MODERATE

Slightly better today because it's Friday and half the civil service probably taking a long weekend. Government workers moving at government speed — slow, but consistent.
