news circus — now with 100% more political drama ☕🇬🇾\n🗳️ OPPOSITION LEADER: FINALLY! MAYBE! MONDAY! What Happened: Speaker Manzoor Nadir announced he will “reluctantly” convene a meeting of opposition MPs on Monday, January 26, at 10 AM to elect the Leader of the Opposition.\nThe Key Word: “Reluctantly.”\nTranslation: “Fine! FINE! I’ll do it! Stop calling me!”\nThe Math:\nGeneral elections: October 2025 Months without Opposition Leader: 3+ Speaker’s level of enthusiasm: “Reluctant” Who’s Likely to Win: Azruddin Mohamed of WIN, which holds 16 of 29 opposition seats. Yes, the same Azruddin Mohamed who is under US sanctions. Democracy is fun!\nThe Diplomatic Nudge: US, UK, Canada, and EU ambassadors all publicly urged Guyana to get this sorted. When four major diplomatic missions are posting on social media about your Parliament, you know things have gotten awkward.\nDem Boys Seh: “Three months to pick one person. At this rate, by de time Opposition Leader sit down, election gon call again.”\n🚔 POLICE ACADEMY: NOT THE COMEDY VERSION What Happened: The Ministry of Home Affairs launched a probe into “serious allegations of sexual exploitation, abuse of authority, and misconduct” at the Guyana Police Force Academy.\nThe Ministry’s Statement: “Any individual—regardless of rank, position, or tenure—found to have engaged in wrongdoing will be charged and held fully accountable under the law.”\nTranslation: Someone’s about to have a very bad week.\nWhat We Know:\nCID and Office of Professional Responsibility investigating Zero tolerance policy invoked Details still emerging What We Don’t Know:\nSpecific allegations How many personnel involved How long this has been happening The Uncomfortable Question: If this is happening at the training academy, what does that say about the culture recruits are being trained into?\nDem Boys Seh: “Dem training officers alright. Just not in wha dem supposed to train.”\n🗑️ GEORGETOWN: EMERGENCY DECLARED, MAYOR GOES MISSING What Happened: City Hall declared a “limited state of solid waste emergency” on Monday. But when Minister Manickchand called a meeting to actually fix the problem, Mayor Mentore and APNU councillors… didn’t show up.\nThe Timeline:\nSunday: Minister Manickchand tells City Hall to present cleanup plan by 11 AM Monday Monday Morning: Mayor agrees to attend meeting Monday 11 AM: Mayor withdraws. No APNU councillors show up. Some who did show up got mysterious phone calls and “hurriedly left the compound” Minister Manickchand’s Assessment: Georgetown residents are being “held hostage to poor politics.”\nThe Solution (So Far): Minister met directly with garbage collectors, who revealed the REAL problem — they haven’t been paid in MONTHS, despite City Hall having the funds.\nCurrent State of Georgetown:\n☐ Clean ☐ Habitable ☑️ Emergency declared ☑️ Political football Dem Boys Seh: “Mayor declare emergency then disappear. Dat is like calling fire brigade and hiding de hydrant.”\n⚔️ APNU vs WIN: OPPOSITION CAN’T EVEN OPPOSE TOGETHER What Happened: A “bitter row” erupted between APNU and WIN over their failure to meet during the past two months. APNU’s Ganesh Mahipaul blamed WIN for not following up with a date, time, and venue.\nThe Irony: The opposition parties can’t even organize a meeting with EACH OTHER, but they want to run the country.\nAPNU’s Position: “WIN didn’t call us back!”\nWIN’s Likely Position: [We’ll get back to you on that]\nThe Real Losers: Guyanese citizens who deserve a functional opposition to hold the government accountable.\nDem Boys Seh: “Opposition fighting opposition while government watching and laughing. Is like watching two people argue bout who gon lose.”\n⚖️ TSC APPOINTMENT: CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OR NAH? What Happened: APNU parliamentary leader Dr. Terrence Campbell is challenging the constitutionality of President Ali’s appointment of the Teaching Service Commission members — arguing it couldn’t be done without an Opposition Leader in place.\nThe Argument: Three TSC members should have been appointed with Opposition Leader input. No Opposition Leader = No valid appointment.\nGovernment’s Likely Response: “Not our fault there’s no Opposition Leader. Take it up with the Speaker.”\nThe Circular Logic:\nCan’t appoint TSC properly without Opposition Leader Opposition can’t agree on Opposition Leader Government proceeds with TSC anyway Opposition cries foul Everyone blames everyone else Teachers still waiting for promotions Dem Boys Seh: “Constitution seh one thing. Politics seh another. Teachers seh ‘we just want get paid properly.’”\n💰 ARMED ROBBERY: $600K GONE IN SECONDS What Happened: A 34-year-old restaurant manager on Smyth Street, Georgetown was robbed at gunpoint of more than $600,000 just outside her workplace around 9:58 PM. She had just collected the day’s earnings.\nThe Pattern: This is exactly the kind of crime that makes business owners nervous — targeted, timed, and brutal.\nThe Question: How did the robbers know she’d be carrying cash at that exact moment?\nPolice Status: Investigating.\nDem Boys Seh: “Bandits know when you getting pay before you does.”\n📱 CHARRANDASS RETURNS: TIKTOK EDITION What Happened: Former AFC parliamentarian Charrandass Persaud — yes, THAT Charrandass whose single vote toppled the APNU+AFC government in 2018 — released a viral TikTok accusing President Ali of abandoning democratic principles and ruling with an “iron fist.”\nThe Quote: Called it “a dictatorship in the making.”\nThe Irony: The man who single-handedly changed Guyana’s political trajectory is now commenting on politics via TikTok. What a time to be alive.\nGovernment’s Likely Response: [Read but not responded to]\nDem Boys Seh: “Charrandass know bout bringing down government. Now he trying from TikTok.”\n🏫 HOSORORO SECONDARY: ONE THAT ACTUALLY OPENED Good News: The newly constructed Hosororo Secondary School in Region One opened its doors, ready to accommodate close to 500 students from Mabaruma. It has its own power generation system and modern facilities.\nWhy This Matters: Hinterland students now have access to secondary education closer to home.\nThe Contrast: While some schools (Tabatinga, Nappi) are still “far from operational readiness,” this one actually opened on schedule.\nCredit Where Due: A school was announced, built, and opened. It happens sometimes.\n🏏 SPORTS CORNER West Indies preparing for T20 World Cup with a three-match series against Afghanistan in Dubai. World Cup starts February 7 in India and Sri Lanka.\nGuyana Women’s Cricket: Defending champions continue strong in CWI Women’s Blaze T20 Championships.\n☀️ WEATHER Georgetown: Partly cloudy with scattered showers of political drama. High of 31°C. 100% chance of garbage still on the streets.\n🎯 FINAL SCORE Topic Status Outlook Opposition Leader Meeting Monday Finally! Police Academy Under investigation Disturbing Georgetown garbage Emergency declared Still stinking APNU vs WIN Fighting each other Messy TSC appointment Being challenged Legal drama That’s your Tuesday. The Opposition Leader is coming (maybe), the Police Academy has a scandal, Georgetown is still a mess, and the opposition can’t even agree to meet each other. Just another day in the Co-operative Republic.\nRead more at guyanadailybrief.com\nDisclaimer: The Guyana Brief is satirical commentary on news reported in Guyana’s four major newspapers.
