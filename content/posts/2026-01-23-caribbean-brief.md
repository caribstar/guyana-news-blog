## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: MOTTLEY CALLS SNAP ELECTION FOR FEB 11

Prime Minister Mia Mottley has announced that Barbados will head to the polls on **February 11, 2026** — marking the second consecutive time she's called an early election with a year remaining in her term.

**Key dates:**
- Parliament dissolves: January 19
- Nomination Day: January 27
- Election Day: February 11

Mottley led the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) to historic **30-0 landslide victories** in both 2018 and 2022, completely shutting out the opposition Democratic Labour Party (DLP). She's seeking a third consecutive term.

"Whilst there is work to be done, there is work for the Barbados Labour Party and its soldiers to do," Mottley told supporters. "When I start to call on you, I don't want you to tell me that you are tired. I want you to tell me, 'Prime Minister, we are ready.'"

The DLP, now led by Ralph Thorne KC (who defected from the BLP in 2024), will be hoping to at least win some seats this time around.

Political scientist Peter Wickham dismissed speculation that the election was driven by international events, saying Mottley's intention to call early elections had been evident since last year.

**The big issues:** Crime and cost of living remain the dominant concerns for Barbadian voters.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: KAMLA NAVIGATES CARICOM TENSIONS

Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been walking a fine line on regional issues since taking office in April 2025.

**Recent developments:**

- Persad-Bissessar defended Trinidad's cooperation with the US on anti-drug operations, stating "no international law was breached"
- She's faced criticism from some CARICOM members over her government's stance on regional issues
- Former PM Keith Rowley launched a "blistering attack" on her, accusing her of "unpatriotic leadership"
- The Antigua and Barbuda government rejected her comments that CARICOM is "not a priority"

The US has also deployed the warship USS Gravely to Trinidad waters, which Persad-Bissessar sought to downplay amid broader regional concerns about US military presence in the Caribbean.

Trinidad, like other Caribbean nations, is navigating the complex aftermath of the US-Venezuela situation and increased American focus on the region.

## ✈️ CARIBBEAN AIRLINES CLOSES BARBADOS HUB

In a major shake-up, Caribbean Airlines has announced it will close its **Barbados operational hub in February 2026**.

Aircraft and crew currently based in Barbados will transition to Trinidad while continuing to serve Barbados routes.

**Routes affected:**
- Trinidad-Barbados-Tortola
- Trinidad-Barbados-San Juan
- Dominica-Puerto Rico connections

Passengers with confirmed reservations after January 10 are being contacted for full refunds.

This follows earlier cancellations of Jamaica-Florida routes in November 2025, indicating a pattern of service reductions as the airline addresses financial challenges.

**Impact for travelers:** 
- Longer connection times
- More complex routing options
- Reduced competition on certain routes
- Potentially higher fares

Budget carrier Avelo Airlines is expanding into the Caribbean market from January 2026, offering alternatives from New Orleans, Tampa, and Providence to Cancún, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.
