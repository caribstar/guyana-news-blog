## 🎯 The Big Story: Former Finance Minister Finally Says What We All Knew

**Former Finance Minister Winston Jordan** has officially admitted what your taxi driver, your auntie, and every rum shop philosopher has been saying for years: **Guyana was exploited by Exxon** during the 2016 oil contract negotiations.

In a recent live broadcast, Jordan explained the circumstances: Venezuela was threatening with Essequibo claims, the rice and sugar industries were failing, and the government needed money to fight the border case at the ICJ.

**Translation:** "We were desperate, they knew we were desperate, and they took full advantage."

Jordan also revealed that Guyana signed away **600 blocks** instead of the industry-standard 60. Yes, you read that right. Ten times more than normal. 

The opposition is using this to slam the PPP for not renegotiating. The PPP is using this to slam the APNU+AFC for signing the deal in the first place. Meanwhile, Exxon is quietly pumping oil and laughing all the way to the bank.

## 🛡️ Border Watch: PM Says We're "Vigilant" After Venezuela Situation

**Prime Minister Mark Phillips** announced that Guyana has strengthened border defences following the recent... *events*... in Venezuela. You know, the ones involving U.S. forces, pre-dawn raids, and the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

The PM said GDF troops are "permanently deployed" along borders with Venezuela, Suriname, and Brazil, and are now in a "heightened state of readiness."

**What this means:** More soldiers watching the jungle. More vigilance. More mosquito bites for our brave troops.

Phillips also visited Region One to meet with defence officials and residents. Nothing says "everything is fine" like the Prime Minister personally checking the borders.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Update: Moleson Creek Road Moving, Schools... Not So Much

**Good News:** The Moleson Creek to Eldorado Road project in Region Six is "gaining momentum." Minister Ramraj says it will unlock thousands of acres of farmland and connect remote riverain communities to coastal markets.

**Translation:** More roads in the jungle. Progress!

**Less Good News:** Opposition MP Sherod Duncan visited two hinterland school projects in Region Nine and expressed "concerns" about progress. The **$215 million Nappi Secondary School** and the **$182 million Tabatinga New Secondary School** apparently aren't moving as fast as promised.

**Duncan's assessment:** The projects meant to accommodate 300+ students aren't on track.

**Government's likely response:** "The opposition is being negative as usual."

## 🗳️ The Leader of Opposition Saga Continues

Trade unionist **Lincoln Lewis** has renewed calls for Parliament to elect an Opposition Leader, saying the process should have been completed "from the very first sitting of the National Assembly."

Meanwhile, **Dr. Henry Jeffrey** wrote a whole column explaining why the PPP is "dragging its feet" on appointing Azruddin Mohamed (whose party WIN is now the largest opposition party).

Letters to the editor are asking why the Speaker hasn't convened the meeting as constitutionally required.

**The score so far:**
- Days without Opposition Leader: Too many to count
- People demanding action: Everyone
- Action taken: Zero

## 💀 Crime Corner: Body Found, Domestic Violence Sentence

**Tragic discovery:** Police found a woman's body in a trench between Barbie Dam and Lamaha Springs, Georgetown. The unidentified woman, believed to be 40-50 years old, was found floating with "several visible marks." Investigation ongoing.

**Justice served:** Dwayne Bishop got **8 months in prison** for assaulting his partner Shellon Zanett at a staff party. He also assaulted Deon Cappelle, a Good Samaritan who tried to intervene. 

When someone driving past sees you beating your partner and stops to help, that's how you know you've truly earned your jail time.

## 🎉 Only In Guyana: Pay-To-Party Culture

**Dem Boys Seh** in Kaieteur News delivered this gem about modern birthday parties:

> "Long time, when somebody got birthday, dem does invite you, feed you, liquor you, and send you home with a doggy bag. Now? Now you paying to celebrate somebody else age increase."

$8,000 early bird admission to sing "Happy Birthday"? Welcome to 2026, Guyana. We've monetized happiness itself.

## 📰 Dem Boys Seh Corner

From Kaieteur News:

> "You pay entrance, you pay drinks, and you still got to sing 'Happy Birthday' with genuine emotion, like you didn't just swipe your bank card to be there. Food included, dem seh — one chicken back, two grains rice, and a plantain slice thin like it pass through GPL blackout."

Guyana really is creative. We even monetize happiness now.

## 💡 The Bottom Line

Start your Monday with this truth bomb: **A former Finance Minister just confirmed on live broadcast that we got fleeced by an oil company.** Not a rumor. Not speculation. The man who was there says it happened.

But hey, at least we're getting roads in Berbice and troops on the border. Progress is progress, even when it comes with an asterisk the size of the Essequibo.

Happy Monday, Guyana! ☕🇬🇾
