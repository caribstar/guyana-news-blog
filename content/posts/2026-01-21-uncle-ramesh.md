## Greetings from the Diaspora!

Another day, another round of selective outrage from the critics. But Uncle Ramesh is here to provide some perspective for my fellow Guyanese overseas who want to understand what's REALLY happening back home.

## 🗳️ ON THE OPPOSITION LEADER SITUATION

So the Speaker finally announced a meeting for Monday to elect the Opposition Leader. Good! But let's be clear about something — the GOVERNMENT didn't cause this delay.

The opposition parties have been fighting among themselves for THREE MONTHS. APNU and WIN can't even agree to meet each other! Now they want to blame the government?

The Speaker has now set a date. Monday, January 26. Let's see if the opposition can actually show up and do their constitutional duty. But somehow, I suspect they'll find something else to complain about.

**My cousin Ravi from Liberty Avenue says:** "But Ramesh, the government should have pushed for this sooner!"

Ravi, the government has NO ROLE in selecting the Opposition Leader. That's the whole point! The opposition needs to get their own house in order. This government is busy actually running the country — building roads, hospitals, and schools — while the opposition is busy fighting with each other.

## 🚔 ON THE POLICE ACADEMY ALLEGATIONS

This is serious, and the government is treating it seriously. Within HOURS of receiving the report, the Ministry of Home Affairs directed the Criminal Investigation Department and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate.

This is what accountability looks like. The government said clearly: "Any individual—regardless of rank, position, or tenure—found to have engaged in wrongdoing will be charged and held fully accountable."

No cover-ups. No delays. No excuses. Investigation launched immediately.

Compare this to previous administrations where allegations would be swept under the rug. This government acts. If anyone is guilty, they will face justice.

## 🗑️ ON GEORGETOWN: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE

Ah, Georgetown. The critics want to blame the government for the garbage situation. But let me ask you something: WHO is responsible for solid waste management in Georgetown?

The answer: THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.

And who is the Mayor? Alfred Mentore of APNU.

Minister Manickchand called a meeting to help resolve the crisis. What did the Mayor do? He BACKED OUT. The APNU councillors got phone calls and "hurriedly left the compound."

The Minister then met DIRECTLY with the garbage collectors and discovered the real problem — City Hall hasn't been paying them for MONTHS, even though the funds are available!

So let me get this straight:
- City Hall has the money
- City Hall isn't paying the contractors
- The garbage piles up
- And somehow this is the government's fault?

The Minister is now working directly with the contractors to solve the problem that City Hall CREATED. That's leadership. That's stepping in when local officials fail.

**My niece Shanti from Richmond Hill says:** "But isn't City Hall starved of funds?"

Shanti, City Hall receives a subvention from central government AND collects rates and taxes. The money is there. The management is the problem. This government even DONATED new garbage bins to Georgetown! At some point, City Hall has to do its job.

## ⚖️ ON THE TSC APPOINTMENT

APNU is challenging the Teaching Service Commission appointments, claiming they're unconstitutional because there's no Opposition Leader.

But wait — WHO is responsible for the delay in appointing an Opposition Leader? The opposition parties themselves!

You can't obstruct the constitutional process for three months and then complain when the government continues to function. Should the entire education system grind to a halt because the opposition can't agree on a leader?

The government is doing its job. Teachers need to be appointed, promoted, and managed. The TSC is necessary for this. Life goes on, whether the opposition gets its act together or not.

## 🏫 ON HOSORORO SECONDARY SCHOOL

Here's a story the critics won't highlight: the Hosororo Secondary School in Region One opened this week, serving nearly 500 hinterland students with modern facilities and its own power generation system.

THIS is what the government is doing while the critics complain. Building schools. Creating opportunities. Bringing education to remote communities.

But you won't see that on the front page, will you? Good news doesn't sell papers.

## 💪 ON GUYANA'S PROGRESS

While the opposition fights among themselves and the critics look for problems, this government continues to deliver:

- **Gas-to-Energy project** progressing on schedule
- **New schools** opening in hinterland communities  
- **Immediate action** on Police Academy allegations
- **Direct intervention** to solve Georgetown's garbage crisis
- **Infrastructure** being built across the country

The diaspora sees it. When we visit home, we see the cranes, the construction, the development. We see a country being transformed.

## 🎯 UNCLE RAMESH'S FINAL WORD

The opposition can't agree among themselves. The Mayor of Georgetown won't show up to meetings. Critics want to blame the government for everything.

But facts are facts:

| What Critics Say | What Actually Happened |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Government blocking Opposition Leader | Opposition parties fighting each other |
| Government responsible for Georgetown mess | City Hall not paying contractors |
| Government ignoring Police Academy issue | Investigation launched within hours |
| Schools not being built | Hosororo Secondary opened this week |

The noise is loud, but the progress is real.

**Until next time, this is Uncle Ramesh from Queens, reminding you: Look past the politics, see the progress!** 🇬🇾
