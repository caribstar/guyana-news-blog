Good morning, Guyana! &#x2615;

Welcome to another week of organized chaos, bureaucratic magic, and statistical creativity.

If you thought the weekend would bring a break—cute. You must be new here.

**Today's Menu:** GuySuCo gets scolded (again), The Mohameds perfect staying put, crime stats get creative, and someone learned why we don't complain about bribery here.

## &#x1F4CA; THE NUMBERS

<div style="background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

**Mohamed Appeal-O-Meter:** 47 appeals filed, 0 relocations

**Days Since Opposition Leader Appeared:** 71 (consistency!)

**GuySuCo Promises vs Reality Gap:** &#x221E;

**Crime down, murders up:** Schrödinger's statistics

</div>

## &#x1F3E2; GUYSUCO: THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON NOT GIVING

President Ali held "The Annual Disappointment Summit" with GuySuCo over the weekend, expressing "strong dissatisfaction" with their failure to meet 2025 targets.

**In other news, water is wet.**

<div style="background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; margin: 20px 0;">

**&#x1F4CA; GuySuCo Track Record:**

- 2023 targets: &#x274C; Missed (weather!)
- 2024 targets: &#x274C; Missed (equipment!)  
- 2025 targets: &#x274C; Missed (circumstances!)
- 2026 targets: &#x2753; *nervous laughter*

**Success rate:** 0% (but very consistent!)

</div>

The consequence for missing targets? *Another stern meeting.* Revolutionary.

Next time maybe a VERY stern meeting. Or an EXTREMELY stern meeting. The possibilities are endless!

At this rate, GuySuCo will hit targets when The Mohameds voluntarily board a plane—which is to say, never.

## &#x23F3; THE MOHAMEDS: PROFESSIONAL STAYERS

Their lawyer said they're "NOT going anywhere." Turns out, 100% accurate. Give that man a Nobel Prize in Honesty.

**Update:** Extradition hearing adjourned to **February 5th**.

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; margin: 20px 0;">

**&#x1F4C5; The Mohamed Calendar™:**

January: File 3 appeals, adjourn hearing

February: File 4 more appeals, adjourn again

March-December: See January-February, repeat with passion

**Status:** Still here, still filing, still making lawyers wealthy

**Departure date:** When GuySuCo meets targets (never)

</div>

US prosecutors asked to "bring forward" the hearing. Adorable. They must be new.

In Guyana's legal system, "expedited" means "eventually," "urgent" means "this decade," and "NOT going anywhere" means exactly that.

**What happens first:**
1. Venus orbits the sun (224 days)
2. A sloth finishes a marathon  
3. The Mohameds board a plane

Spoiler: Venus.

## &#x1F4C9; CRIME STATS: CREATIVE MATHEMATICS

The Police Force dropped their 2025 report: **Serious crimes down 25.5%!** &#x1F389;

**The fine print:** *Side effects include increased murders. Do not operate statistics while reading reality.*

<div style="background-color: #FFEBEE; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #F44336; margin: 20px 0;">

**&#x1F4CA; The ACTUAL Numbers:**

- Murders: UP 11%
- Road deaths: UP 6% (137 people)
- "Serious crimes": Down 25.5%! &#x1F389;

**Formula:** Crime is down if you don't count the crimes!

</div>

It's like saying your diet's amazing because you lost 5 pounds—just don't mention the 15 you gained first.

**Things apparently NOT "serious crimes":**
- Murder (up 11%)
- Vehicular manslaughter (up 6%)
- Filing 47 appeals to avoid extradition

**Things that ARE "serious crimes":**
- Posting videos about gun licenses (see Stanley Basdeo below)

The GPF expects celebration while murders are rising. It's like celebrating the Titanic's dry ballroom while the ship sank.

## &#x1F6A4; RIP GOLDEN GLOVES: 70 YEARS WASN'T ENOUGH

After **SEVENTY YEARS** of service, Golden Gloves speedboat was shut down by the GRA for "irregularities."

**What existed in 1955:**
- Golden Gloves &#x2705;
- The Soviet Union &#x2705;
- Polio vaccine &#x2705;

**What doesn't exist anymore:**
- All of the above &#x274C;

<div style="background-color: #E0F2F1; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #009688; margin: 20px 0;">

**&#x1F4CA; Survival Guide:**

**What survives:**
- &#x2705; Mohamed legal defense (IMMORTAL)
- &#x2705; GuySuCo missing targets (ETERNAL)

**What doesn't:**
- &#x274C; 70-year businesses (paperwork issues)
- &#x274C; Heroes Highway (25 months max)
- &#x274C; Opposition leadership (missing)

</div>

**Golden Gloves survived:**
- Independence, multiple governments, economic crises, the Cold War, Y2K, the ENTIRE Mohamed saga

**What killed it?**
*Paperwork irregularities.*

After 70 years, NOW is regulation time.

Meanwhile, The Mohameds have been "regularising" for years with 47 appeals. Nobody's stopping THEM.

## &#x1F4B0; STANLEY BASDEO: COMPLAINED TOO LOUDLY

US businessman Stanley Basdeo posted a video about:
1. Difficulty getting gun licenses
2. Bribery in Guyana

**Government's response:** CYBERCRIME CHARGES.

<div style="background-color: #ECEFF1; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #607D8B; margin: 20px 0;">

**&#x1F4CA; Legal Response Times:**

Charging video complaint: &#x26A1; 24 hours

Extraditing actual criminals: &#x1F40C; 847+ days

Fixing bribery he mentioned: &#x1F914; *File not found*

</div>

**The crime:** Making a video about stuff everyone knows.

**The punishment:** $200,000 bail + surrendered passport.

**For comparison:**
- The Mohameds: 47 appeals, still have passports
- Stanley: 1 video, passport confiscated

**The irony:** He complained about bribery and now he's in the legal system where... well, you get it.

**Things you CAN do:**
- File infinite appeals &#x2705;
- Miss targets annually &#x2705;

**Things you CANNOT do:**
- Post videos about bribery &#x274C;

**Lesson:** You can file 47 appeals (fine!), but you cannot post one (1) video about systemic issues (CYBERCRIME!).

## &#x1F4C5; THE WEEK AHEAD

**Monday:** Last week's chaos was an aberration. (It wasn't.)

**Tuesday:** "On track" update #848. Drinking game optional.

**Wednesday:** Mohamed appeal #48. Lawyer buys third vacation home.

**Thursday:** GuySuCo misses micro-target. Blames solar flares.

**Friday:** New timeline announced. Immediately obsolete.

**Probability GuySuCo meets target:** 0.1%

**Probability Mohameds board plane:** *Cannot calculate impossibility*

---

## &#x1F4DD; THE BOTTOM LINE

Another Monday of delays (sorry, "adjustments"), projects "firmly on track" (hopelessly behind), and crime stats that defy mathematics.

**The pattern:**

Work 70 years? Paperwork violation.

File appeals for 2+ years? Carry on!

Meet targets? What's a target? —GuySuCo

Post videos? Cybercrime within 24 hours.

But hey, at least Costco toilet paper is coming (Feb 5). Given the amount of BS we wade through, we'll need it.

**Stay chaotic, Guyana.** &#x1F1EC;&#x1F1FE;

*P.S. - If complaints are cybercrime, this newsletter is toast. See you in court! (In 847 days, after 47 adjournments.)*
