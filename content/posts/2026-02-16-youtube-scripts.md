## 4-MINUTE SCRIPT — Monday Deep Dive

**[INTRO — 15 seconds]**

Good morning Guyana! Your Monday deep dive is here. Azruddin can't tell time, the Haags Bosch office is eating money like pac-man, and some good news on mortgages and healthcare. Let's go.

**[SEGMENT 1 — Azruddin Late to Court — 75 seconds]**

The most talked-about moment of the day: Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed showed up twenty-five minutes late to his extradition committal hearing at the Georgetown Magistrates' Court. Principal Magistrate Judy Latchman issued an arrest warrant at nine-oh-five when he didn't appear. His lawyers asked for five minutes. He didn't make that window either.

When he finally arrived around nine-thirty, pushing past reporters, the Magistrate recalled the warrant but was not pleased. Her quote: "I will temper justice with mercy" — which is judicial language for "you got lucky, don't push it."

Remember, this man is the leader of the opposition party WIN. He's US-indicted alongside his father Nazar, who was reportedly too unwell to attend. The proceedings continue Wednesday.

**[SEGMENT 2 — Haags Bosch and Government Spending — 60 seconds]**

The government office complex at Haags Bosch on the East Bank is now projected to cost nineteen-point-six billion dollars. Nearly ten billion has already been spent. For an office building.

Meanwhile, APNU is slamming the government for spending eighteen-point-eight billion in the last two months of 2025 without parliamentary approval until February. MP Ganesh Mahipaul called it rubber stamp governance and forced a division vote for the record.

The pattern continues: spend first, ask permission later.

**[SEGMENT 3 — Good News Corner — 60 seconds]**

But it's not all doom. Republic Bank has launched mortgages up to sixty million dollars at five percent interest with no ceiling on the amount you can borrow for residential housing. This is a direct response to the government's housing agenda.

Guyana is also projecting a decline in new HIV infections this year, with strong treatment results. And a hybrid nursing programme developed with the WHO is set to graduate eight hundred nurses, transforming the health workforce.

**[SEGMENT 4 — Schoonard and Cost of Living — 45 seconds]**

The story that should make everyone uncomfortable: residents of Schoonard, mostly single mothers living near Joe Vieira Park, have been given just one week to relocate. The government wants to build a recreational park.

Kaieteur News also ran a powerful editorial about cost-of-living pain, crediting opposition figures for raising the issue but questioning whether the massive budgets are actually reaching ordinary Guyanese.

That's your Monday. Energy Conference starts tomorrow. Court continues Wednesday. Full coverage at guyanadailybrief.com. Stay informed!
