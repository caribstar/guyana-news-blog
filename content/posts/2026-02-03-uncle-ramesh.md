*Uncle Ramesh is a retired accountant from Berbice, now living in Queens, New York. He reads all four Guyanese newspapers every morning and provides his pro-government perspective on the day's news.*

Aright, aright, aright. Leh me start with the Chronicle because today? Today was a GOOD day for this country, and the Brief don't want you to know that.

## THE BUDGET DEBATE — EDGHILL DID HE THING

First of all, Minister Edghill get up there and lay out the facts. $227 BILLION for public works. The Bharrat Jagdeo Bridge — US$260 million, connecting Region Three and Four. The Heroes Highway. New hinterland airstrips. Ferry vessels bringing down cost of living in the interior.

And what the opposition do? Animal noises. ANIMAL NOISES in Parliament! This is the quality of representation we dealing with? The Brief want to make joke about it, but lemme tell you — when you cyaan argue with facts, you make noise. Simple.

## UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN — AND THAT IS FACTS

President Ali cite Bureau of Statistics data — unemployment drop from 12.8% to 6.8%. Female unemployment from 14.4% to under 9%. These ain't campaign promises. These are STATISTICS. From the BUREAU OF STATISTICS.

The Brief say "opposition says prove it." Well, the Bureau of Statistics just proved it! What more you want? You want the President to come to your house and count your neighbours' jobs personally?

This government diversify the economy. Agriculture, construction, services, tourism, oil and gas — every sector growing. The numbers don't lie, even if the opposition wish they did.

## ALI IN BELIZE — REGIONAL LEADERSHIP

While the opposition was making barnyard sounds in Parliament, President Ali was in Belize addressing their National Assembly like a HEAD OF STATE. He talking about food security, regional trade barriers, Caribbean cooperation.

The Brief make some snide remark about the Speaker and press freedom in the same breath. But tell me — which other Caribbean leader get invited to address foreign parliaments? Ali talking to Belize about sugar cooperation, agricultural investment, and small-state strategy. That is LEADERSHIP.

And the sugar cooperation? The Chronicle report that Belize and Guyana moving to deepen ties in the sugar industry. Two countries with sugar history working together. That is smart policy.

## GUYSUCO — THE COMEBACK IS REAL

Minister Mustapha say sugar production up 26% in 2024 and hit 59,000 tonnes in 2025. Budget 2026 allocate $13.4 billion.

The Brief make joke about "profitability loyalty card." But tell me this — who close the sugar estates? APNU. Who fire 7,000 sugar workers? APNU. Who bring back the industry? PPP/C. The numbers speak.

And before anybody forget — the former agriculture director at GuySuCo who oversaw the "colossal failures"? He now a WIN MP. So when WIN criticize agriculture spending, remember who was running agriculture into the ground.

## THE GOLD SMUGGLING IRONY

Now this? THIS is the story of the day. WIN MP Dr. André Lewis stand up in Parliament — in his MAIDEN speech — and demand mining oversight and transparency. Meanwhile, the LEADER of his party, Azruddin Mohamed, is fighting extradition to Florida on ELEVEN COUNTS including gold smuggling, wire fraud, and money laundering.

A US$50 million gold-export scheme. A Lamborghini Roadster imported illegally. And this party want to lecture GOVERNMENT about mining transparency?

The Chronicle put it perfectly. You cyaan preach about gold oversight when your boss is the one allegedly stealing the gold.

## THE SABGA AWARD

One thing the Brief barely mentioned — a Guyanese-American biotech innovator win a major Caribbean excellence award. This is the kind of thing that shows Guyana producing world-class talent. The PPP/C government investment in education, in GOAL scholarships, in creating opportunity — this is what it produce.

Speaking of GOAL — 32 scholars just completed PhD programmes. FREE. Online. Through Texila American University. 27 in management, 5 in public health. Under this government, advanced education becoming accessible.

## ON THE PRESS THING

The Brief making big noise about Speaker Nadir and the five-journalist limit. Look — I ain't saying I agree with the number. But let me ask this: when APNU was in government and they refuse to hold press conferences for MONTHS, where was the outrage? When David Granger used to cherry-pick which journalist get to ask questions? Nobody wasn't writing editorials then.

The budget debate is being LIVESTREAMED. Every Guyanese with a phone can watch. Five journalists in the room plus a camera broadcasting to the entire nation. This isn't a media blackout — it's a logistical arrangement that probably could use adjustment, yes. But comparing it to press oppression? Come on now.

## THE GENDER EQUALITY SEAL

Minister Persaud announce something historic — Guyana introducing a Gender Empowerment and Equality Seal. FIRST IN THE CARIBBEAN. For public and private sector. Safer workplaces, equal opportunities.

Plus the WIIN programme train 21,000 women. The Because We Care grant at $85,000 per child. Free prostheses costing $1 million each. Free hearing aids.

This is what $70 billion direct to beneficiaries look like. But Singh-Lewis from WIN say it's a "farce." A farce that putting money in 90,000 pensioners' pockets every month.

## BOTTOM LINE

The opposition can't decide what they against. WIN say oil spending reckless. APNU say agriculture spending too low. WIN say the budget is disconnected from reality. APNU say give farmers more money. They can't even agree on what to be angry about.

Meanwhile, this government delivering infrastructure, education, social services, and regional leadership — simultaneously. The budget ain't perfect. No budget ever is. But calling it a "farce" while your party leader dodging extradition? That is the real farce.

Leh dem debate. The people already know who building this country.

*Uncle Ramesh signing off from Queens. Budget 2026 get me support, and the numbers back me up.* 🇬🇾
