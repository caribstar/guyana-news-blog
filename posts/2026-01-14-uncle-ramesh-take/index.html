  "articleBody": "CLE RAMESH’S HOT TAKE Tuesday, January 14, 2026\n[Uncle Ramesh on his verandah, Tuesday morning, coffee in hand, reading The Brief with increasing exasperation]\nAlright, alright, ALRIGHT.\nI just finish reading today’s “Brief” and lemme tell you somethingâ€”these people making joke about EVERYTHING while the government actually FIXING the country!\nLAW YEAR OPENING: NOT A JOKE The Brief making fun of the AG pointing out magistrates not following the law? THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT!\nYou know why Nandlall had to stand up there and REMIND people that plea-bargaining is MANDATORY? Because for YEARSâ€”under the previous governmentâ€”nobody enforced these modern laws! The legislation was passed but collecting dust!\nThis is EXACTLY what reform looks like:\nIdentifying where system failing Calling it out publicly Demanding accountability Following up with action The Brief making jokes, saying “everyone remembered laws exist.” No! The AG is doing his JOB by ensuring the judiciary IMPLEMENTS the laws Parliament passed!\nAnd Chancellor George revealing they handled 30,000 criminal cases with staff shortages? That’s TRANSPARENCY! That’s asking for support! That’s the judiciary saying “we need help” instead of hiding the problems!\nReality Check for The Brief: You can’t fix problems you don’t acknowledge. The 2026 Law Year opening was about HONEST ASSESSMENT, not ceremony!\nRE NOT A JOKE, PEOPLE Ohhhhh, The Brief really showing their ignorance now.\nMaking fun of government apps? Let me EDUCATE you:\nDo you know what these apps represent?\nDirect accountability - You can now DOCUMENT your complaint with timestamp Transparency - Everyone can see response times Data collection - Government can identify problem areas Accessibility - No more driving to Georgetown to file complaint Modern governance - What first-world countries been doing for DECADE The Brief saying “What about government WiFi?” - THAT’S WHY THEY MAKING THE APPS! To work on YOUR phone with YOUR data!\nMinister Manickchand being honest: “You get response in 24 hours but action may take longer.” That’s REALISTIC EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT! Better than promising magic and delivering nothing!\nThe old system: Call NDC. Maybe someone answer. Maybe they write it down. Maybe they remember. Maybe something happen.\nThe new system: App. Receipt. Tracking. Accountability. Follow-up.\nBut sure, make jokes. Stay in 1990s while government trying to bring country to 2026.\nTO HIGHWAYS: RESPECTING THE ENGINEERING The Brief really showed their backside here.\nMaking fun of President Ali for pointing out they draining swamps to build highways? You think that EASY?\nLet me break it down for the smart people making jokes:\nBuilding roads in Guyana involves:\nDealing with water table issues Installing MASSIVE drainage systems Soil stabilization (you can’t just pour asphalt on swamp!) Environmental management Coordinating multiple contractors Managing logistics in challenging terrain When President said “This shows full understanding of development and urban planning,” he’s RIGHT! Because they PLANNING FOR DRAINAGE before building, not after!\nYou know what happens when you build without proper drainage? Look at some roads in Georgetown that flood every rain!\nAnd about the Linden-Mabura road being delayed?\nThe Brief joking “add 6 months to every deadline” - but they not mentioning:\nUK (the FUNDER) confirmed December 2025 was unrealistic Project is 62% complete (that’s MORE than half!) Contractors doing 7km of paving PER MONTH New realistic target is September 2026 Would you rather:\nGovernment lie and say “almost done” when it not? Or government give HONEST UPDATES with REAL TIMELINES? The Ali government chose transparency. But The Brief prefer jokes.\nâš¡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: THE BRIEF DOESN’T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS This one REALLY burn me up.\nThe Brief asking “Why not solar?” and throwing around numbers like they know something.\nLet me educate these comedians:\nWhy Gas-to-Energy makes sense:\nBase Load Power - Solar only works when sun shining! Gas provides 24/7 RELIABLE power We HAVE the gas - It’s OUR resource, coming up with oil anyway. Use it or waste it! Job Creation - Long-term technical jobs, not just installation Energy Security - Not dependent on imported solar panels Grid Stability - Consistent output, not weather-dependent Cost Certainty - We control the supply, not subject to global solar panel prices The Brief’s solar comparison is MISLEADING:\nArgentina project had Chinese financing (different terms) Philippines has different labor costs Wisconsin? They comparing TROPICAL GUYANA to WISCONSIN? None of these countries had FREE NATURAL GAS coming out the ground! The real question: Why would we NOT use our own natural resource when we can combine it with renewables LATER?\nThe Skeldon Sugar Factory failed because of MIS-MANAGEMENT, not because using local resources is wrong!\nThe Brief making false equivalencies and calling them “uncomfortable questions.” Noâ€”they just asking UNINFORMED questions!\n: GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT DUE The Brief mocking Dr. Singh for saying population growth “vindicates government policy.”\nBut IS HE WRONG?\nFacts:\nUnder previous government: MASS EMIGRATION Under current government: People STAYING and RETURNING Oil money ALONE doesn’t make country livable (look at some oil-rich countries!) Government invested in: healthcare, education, infrastructure, jobs You think people just having more children for no reason? Or remigrating because weather nice?\nNO!\nPeople staying because:\nEconomic opportunities Better healthcare Infrastructure improving Government creating environment for growth But The Brief want to credit “biology” for population growth?\nStupidness!\nIf conditions were TERRIBLE, people would STILL be leaving regardless of oil money! Look at Venezuelaâ€”they have oil and people FLEEING!\nThe government creating CONDITIONS for growth. The census PROVES IT. But The Brief too busy making jokes to acknowledge SUCCESS.\nâš–ï¸ THE MOHAMEDS: INTERESTING HOW THE BRIEF REPORTS THIS “Still here, still fighting” - Real cute.\nBut notice The Brief suddenly not making jokes here? Because the truth is:\nPeople showed up to court Court system working Due process being followed Nobody being persecuted If this was REAL persecution, would they be getting warrants withdrawn? Would their LAWYER be able to request adjournments?\nThe Brief making light of it, but the FACTS show fair treatment!\n: EVEN THE BRIEF CAN’T RUIN THIS For once, The Brief right: Our women’s cricket team is EXCELLENT and needs no satire!\nSeven-run victory defending 96 runs? That’s GUYANESE EXCELLENCE in action!\nSee? When you SUPPORT instead of MOCK, results speak for themselves!\nRAMESH’S FINAL WORD Today’s Brief showed something important: They don’t understand the difference between progress and perfection.\nYes:\nApps might crash (then we fix them!) Laws were being ignored (now being enforced!) Roads take longer than planned (but they GETTING BUILT!) Projects cost money (but creating VALUE!) This is called DEVELOPMENT!\nYou can’t joke your way to progress. You can’t satirize roads into existence. You can’t mock apps into working better.\nThe government is DOING THE WORK. The Brief is making JOKES.\nAsk yourself: Who contributing more to Guyana’s future?\nThe people building infrastructure, creating accountability systems, enforcing laws, and being transparent about challenges?\nOr the people making cute jokes from the sidelines?\nI know my answer.\nAL NUMBERS What The Brief Called “White Elephants”: Actually functioning infrastructure\nWhat The Brief Called “Slow Progress”: Realistic timelines with transparency\nWhat The Brief Called “Questionable”: Strategic use of natural resources\nWhat The Brief Called “Spin”: Accurate assessment of census data\nUncle Ramesh puts down his paper, shaking his head\nThese young people think cynicism is intelligence.\nI call it LAZINESS.\nUntil tomorrow, when I educate them again.\nStay informed. Stay supportive. Stay REALISTIC.\nUncle Ramesh - Your diaspora uncle who actually understands development doesn’t happen overnight, and apps are better than the old “hope somebody remembers your complaint” system.\nTags: #UnclRamesh #Opinion #ProGovernment #Development #RealTalk #GuyanaProgress\n",

<p><em>[Uncle Ramesh on his verandah, Tuesday morning, coffee in hand, reading The Brief with increasing exasperation]</em></p>
<p>Alright, alright, ALRIGHT.</p>
<p>I just finish reading today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brief&rdquo; and lemme tell you somethingâ€”these people making joke about EVERYTHING while the government actually FIXING the country!</p>
<h2 id="law-year-opening-not-a-joke">LAW YEAR OPENING: NOT A JOKE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#law-year-opening-not-a-joke">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief making fun of the AG pointing out magistrates not following the law? THAT&rsquo;S THE WHOLE POINT!</p>
<p>You know why Nandlall had to stand up there and REMIND people that plea-bargaining is MANDATORY? Because for YEARSâ€”under the previous governmentâ€”nobody enforced these modern laws! The legislation was passed but collecting dust!</p>
<p><strong>This is EXACTLY what reform looks like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying where system failing</li>
<li>Calling it out publicly</li>
<li>Demanding accountability</li>
<li>Following up with action</li>
</ul>
<p>The Brief making jokes, saying &ldquo;everyone remembered laws exist.&rdquo; No! The AG is doing his JOB by ensuring the judiciary IMPLEMENTS the laws Parliament passed!</p>
<p>And Chancellor George revealing they handled 30,000 criminal cases with staff shortages? That&rsquo;s TRANSPARENCY! That&rsquo;s asking for support! That&rsquo;s the judiciary saying &ldquo;we need help&rdquo; instead of hiding the problems!</p>

<h2 id="re-not-a-joke-people">RE NOT A JOKE, PEOPLE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#re-not-a-joke-people">#</a></h2>
<p>Ohhhhh, The Brief really showing their ignorance now.</p>
<p>Making fun of government apps? Let me EDUCATE you:</p>
<p><strong>Do you know what these apps represent?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Direct accountability</strong> - You can now DOCUMENT your complaint with timestamp</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Everyone can see response times</li>
<li><strong>Data collection</strong> - Government can identify problem areas</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - No more driving to Georgetown to file complaint</li>
<li><strong>Modern governance</strong> - What first-world countries been doing for DECADE</li>
</ol>
<p>The Brief saying &ldquo;What about government WiFi?&rdquo; - THAT&rsquo;S WHY THEY MAKING THE APPS! To work on YOUR phone with YOUR data!</p>
<p>Minister Manickchand being honest: &ldquo;You get response in 24 hours but action may take longer.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s REALISTIC EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT! Better than promising magic and delivering nothing!</p>
<p><strong>The old system:</strong> Call NDC. Maybe someone answer. Maybe they write it down. Maybe they remember. Maybe something happen.</p>
<p><strong>The new system:</strong> App. Receipt. Tracking. Accountability. Follow-up.</p>
<p>But sure, make jokes. Stay in 1990s while government trying to bring country to 2026.</p>

<p>The Brief really showed their backside here.</p>
<p>Making fun of President Ali for pointing out they draining swamps to build highways? You think that EASY?</p>
<p>Let me break it down for the smart people making jokes:</p>
<p><strong>Building roads in Guyana involves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with water table issues</li>
<li>Installing MASSIVE drainage systems</li>
<li>Soil stabilization (you can&rsquo;t just pour asphalt on swamp!)</li>
<li>Environmental management</li>
<li>Coordinating multiple contractors</li>
<li>Managing logistics in challenging terrain</li>
</ul>
<p>When President said &ldquo;This shows full understanding of development and urban planning,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s RIGHT! Because they PLANNING FOR DRAINAGE before building, not after!</p>
<p>You know what happens when you build without proper drainage? Look at some roads in Georgetown that flood every rain!</p>
<p><strong>And about the Linden-Mabura road being delayed?</strong></p>
<p>The Brief joking &ldquo;add 6 months to every deadline&rdquo; - but they not mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK (the FUNDER) confirmed December 2025 was unrealistic</li>
<li>Project is 62% complete (that&rsquo;s MORE than half!)</li>
<li>Contractors doing 7km of paving PER MONTH</li>
<li>New realistic target is September 2026</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you rather:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government lie and say &ldquo;almost done&rdquo; when it not?</li>
<li>Or government give HONEST UPDATES with REAL TIMELINES?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ali government chose transparency. But The Brief prefer jokes.</p>

<h2 id="âš-gas-to-energy-the-brief-doesnt-understand-economics">âš¡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: THE BRIEF DOESN&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#âš-gas-to-energy-the-brief-doesnt-understand-economics">#</a></h2>
<p>This one REALLY burn me up.</p>
<p>The Brief asking &ldquo;Why not solar?&rdquo; and throwing around numbers like they know something.</p>
<p>Let me educate these comedians:</p>
<p><strong>Why Gas-to-Energy makes sense:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base Load Power</strong> - Solar only works when sun shining! Gas provides 24/7 RELIABLE power</li>
<li><strong>We HAVE the gas</strong> - It&rsquo;s OUR resource, coming up with oil anyway. Use it or waste it!</li>
<li><strong>Job Creation</strong> - Long-term technical jobs, not just installation</li>
<li><strong>Energy Security</strong> - Not dependent on imported solar panels</li>
<li><strong>Grid Stability</strong> - Consistent output, not weather-dependent</li>
<li><strong>Cost Certainty</strong> - We control the supply, not subject to global solar panel prices</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s solar comparison is MISLEADING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Argentina project had Chinese financing (different terms)</li>
<li>Philippines has different labor costs</li>
<li>Wisconsin? They comparing TROPICAL GUYANA to WISCONSIN?</li>
<li>None of these countries had FREE NATURAL GAS coming out the ground!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The real question:</strong> Why would we NOT use our own natural resource when we can combine it with renewables LATER?</p>
<p>The Skeldon Sugar Factory failed because of MIS-MANAGEMENT, not because using local resources is wrong!</p>
<p>The Brief making false equivalencies and calling them &ldquo;uncomfortable questions.&rdquo; Noâ€”they just asking UNINFORMED questions!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-giving-credit-where-credit-due">: GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT DUE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-giving-credit-where-credit-due">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief mocking Dr. Singh for saying population growth &ldquo;vindicates government policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But IS HE WRONG?</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under previous government: MASS EMIGRATION</li>
<li>Under current government: People STAYING and RETURNING</li>
<li>Oil money ALONE doesn&rsquo;t make country livable (look at some oil-rich countries!)</li>
<li>Government invested in: healthcare, education, infrastructure, jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>You think people just having more children for no reason? Or remigrating because weather nice?</p>
<p><strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>People staying because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic opportunities</li>
<li>Better healthcare</li>
<li>Infrastructure improving</li>
<li>Government creating environment for growth</li>
</ul>
<p>But The Brief want to credit &ldquo;biology&rdquo; for population growth?</p>
<p>Stupidness!</p>
<p>If conditions were TERRIBLE, people would STILL be leaving regardless of oil money! Look at Venezuelaâ€”they have oil and people FLEEING!</p>
<p>The government creating CONDITIONS for growth. The census PROVES IT. But The Brief too busy making jokes to acknowledge SUCCESS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still here, still fighting&rdquo; - Real cute.</p>
<p>But notice The Brief suddenly not making jokes here? Because the truth is:</p>
<ul>
<li>People showed up to court</li>
<li>Court system working</li>
<li>Due process being followed</li>
<li>Nobody being persecuted</li>
</ul>
<p>If this was REAL persecution, would they be getting warrants withdrawn? Would their LAWYER be able to request adjournments?</p>
<p>The Brief making light of it, but the FACTS show fair treatment!</p>

<h2 id="-even-the-brief-cant-ruin-this">: EVEN THE BRIEF CAN&rsquo;T RUIN THIS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-even-the-brief-cant-ruin-this">#</a></h2>
<p>For once, The Brief right: Our women&rsquo;s cricket team is EXCELLENT and needs no satire!</p>
<p>Seven-run victory defending 96 runs? That&rsquo;s GUYANESE EXCELLENCE in action!</p>
<p>See? When you SUPPORT instead of MOCK, results speak for themselves!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rameshs-final-word">RAMESH&rsquo;S FINAL WORD<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rameshs-final-word">#</a></h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Brief showed something important: <strong>They don&rsquo;t understand the difference between progress and perfection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apps might crash (then we fix them!)</li>
<li>Laws were being ignored (now being enforced!)</li>
<li>Roads take longer than planned (but they GETTING BUILT!)</li>
<li>Projects cost money (but creating VALUE!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is called DEVELOPMENT!</strong></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t joke your way to progress. You can&rsquo;t satirize roads into existence. You can&rsquo;t mock apps into working better.</p>
<p>The government is DOING THE WORK. The Brief is making JOKES.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Who contributing more to Guyana&rsquo;s future?</p>
<p>The people building infrastructure, creating accountability systems, enforcing laws, and being transparent about challenges?</p>
<p>Or the people making cute jokes from the sidelines?</p>
<p>I know my answer.</p>
<h2 id="al-numbers">AL NUMBERS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#al-numbers">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>What The Brief Called &ldquo;White Elephants&rdquo;:</strong> Actually functioning infrastructure<br>
<strong>What The Brief Called &ldquo;Slow Progress&rdquo;:</strong> Realistic timelines with transparency<br>
<strong>What The Brief Called &ldquo;Questionable&rdquo;:</strong> Strategic use of natural resources<br>
<strong>What The Brief Called &ldquo;Spin&rdquo;:</strong> Accurate assessment of census data</p>

<p><em>Uncle Ramesh puts down his paper, shaking his head</em></p>
<p>These young people think cynicism is intelligence.</p>
<p>I call it LAZINESS.</p>
<p>Until tomorrow, when I educate them again.</p>
<p><strong>Stay informed. Stay supportive. Stay REALISTIC.</strong></p>
