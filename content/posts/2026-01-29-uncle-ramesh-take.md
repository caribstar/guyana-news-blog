*A Pro-Government Perspective from Queens, NY* 🗽🇬🇾

---

## Nephew and Niece Dem,

Greetings from Queens where the cold biting but my heart warm from reading about all the good things happening back home!

Let me tell you, I just finish reading through the Budget 2026 details and I nearly fall off me chair with joy! **$1.558 TRILLION dollars!** That is the biggest budget in Guyana history! And what the critics have to say? "Rich getting richer." Eh-eh! When the country was poor and nothing wasn't happening, dem same people was complaining. Now we building and spending, and dem still complaining!

## 💰 The $100,000 Cash Grant Is Coming!

You know what I love about this government? They actually putting money DIRECTLY in people hands. Every single Guyanese adult getting $100,000. That is not "trickle down economics" – that is FLOOD THE PEOPLE economics! 

Over $60 BILLION going directly to citizens. My cousin Doodnauth wife already planning what she doing with the money. (She want to fix the kitchen, he want to fix the car – same argument every Guyanese couple having right now!)

And the Because We Care grant up to $60,000 now! That is real support for families with children. President Ali promised to put the people first, and Budget 2026 is proving it!

## 🏗️ The Building Never Stop

Look at these numbers:
- **$183.6 billion** for education – FREE university for every Guyanese!
- **$161.1 billion** for health – new hospitals, new equipment, better care
- **$159.1 billion** for housing – 15,000 house lots, 8,000 new homes
- **$196.1 billion** for roads and bridges

When I left Guyana in the 80s, we couldn't dream of these numbers. Now look at we! The government building Guyana like never before. And the opposition? Walking out of Parliament instead of doing their job!

## 🚶 APNU Walking Out Again

Speaking of the opposition – they walked out of the meeting to elect Opposition Leader! Mark them as "absent" – that is exactly what they are. ABSENT from doing their duty! 

For months now, no Opposition Leader. And whose fault is that? Not the government! The Speaker called the meeting, followed the Constitution, and APNU decided to throw a tantrum and walk out. 

You can't complain about democracy while refusing to participate in democratic processes! The PPP/C ready to govern. The opposition just ready to complain and walk out.

## 🏭 RUSAL Coming Back!

This is BIG news that the Daily Brief barely touch. RUSAL coming back to Berbice! Jobs returning! The economy diversifying!

Remember when they left six years ago and everybody was doom and gloom? The PPP/C never gave up on that region. They kept negotiating, kept working, and now – success! 

That is what real governance looks like. Not walking out of meetings. Not complaining on social media. RESULTS.

## 🎭 Mashramani Time!

60 years as a Republic! And what better way to celebrate than with the biggest Mashramani yet? The theme "Expressing our Culture through Innovation and Creativity" is perfect. We preserving we culture while moving forward.

I might just have to come home for this one. My wife already saying she want to lime on Main Street for the parade. After all these cold New York winters, a little Mash sunshine sounds like heaven!

## 🌍 Venezuela Situation

Now, some people trying to criticize the government response to the Venezuela situation. But let me tell you – PM Phillips handling this with maturity and wisdom. Troops on alert, border secured, but no inflammatory statements. 

That is how a small country navigate big power politics. You don't run your mouth. You protect your people and stay vigilant. The PPP/C understand diplomacy. Unlike some people who would probably start an international incident with a tweet.

## 📊 The Facts Speak

Critics can complain all they want, but look at the FACTS:
- Economy grew **19.3%** overall in 2025
- Non-oil economy grew **14.3%** 
- Record **453,489 tourists** in 2025
- Biggest budget in history
- Direct cash transfers to citizens

This is a government that is DELIVERING. Not promising, not talking – DELIVERING.

## My Message Today

To my PPP/C family: Keep working. Keep building. The people see what you doing, and they will remember.

To the opposition: Stop walking out and start working. The people didn't vote for you to be absent. If you have better ideas, bring them to the table. But you have to be AT the table first!

To Guyanese everywhere: Be proud! Our country is rising. Don't let the negativity distract you from the progress we making.
