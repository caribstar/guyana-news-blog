&lt;p>&lt;strong>[TITLE CARD: GUYANA DAILY BRIEF — FRIDAY FEBRUARY 13, 2026]&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guyana, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th and the news matches the energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stabroek News — thirty-nine years of independent journalism — is shutting down. March 15th. Done. Not because of politics. Because Facebook killed the advertising model. Two thousand US newspapers already went the same way. Now it&amp;rsquo;s our turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgetown flooded again. Four inches of rain in four hours. Ministers rushed to the field. Pumps activated. But here&amp;rsquo;s the question: trillion-dollar budget, same flooding problems?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>📊 Patriots Portfolio – Friday, February 13, 2026</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-13-patriots-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-13-patriots-portfolio/</guid><description>Your weekly economic snapshot.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Backstory:&lt;/strong> Just one year ago, the government was &amp;ldquo;committed to making future cash grants.&amp;rdquo; What a difference 365 days makes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Welcome to Tuesday, where census data finally arrives (only 4 years late!) and Parliament continues its record-breaking streak of doing absolutely nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today&amp;rsquo;s menu:&lt;/strong> Census numbers drop after a 4-year delay, oil wells still racing toward empty, Parliament enters Week 11 of ghosting us, and unauthorized supermarkets get shut down faster than you can say &amp;ldquo;planning permission.&amp;rdquo; Also, Guyana can&amp;rsquo;t say no to the US.

&lt;p>Welcome to Monday, where last week&amp;rsquo;s problems are this week&amp;rsquo;s problems with a fresh coat of optimistic denial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing got fixed over the weekend. Shocked? You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today&amp;rsquo;s menu:&lt;/strong> GuySuCo gets scolded (again), The Mohameds perfect the art of not leaving, crime stats achieve Olympic-level creativity, and we learn why complaining about bribery is somehow worse than actual bribery. Just another week in paradise!&lt;/p>
