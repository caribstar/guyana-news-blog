## SCRIPT 1: 60-SECOND SHORT — "Opposition Leader Arrested for Being 35 Minutes Late"

**[HOOK — 0:00-0:05]**
The Opposition Leader got ARRESTED yesterday. Not for fraud. Not for the extradition. For being THIRTY-FIVE minutes late.

**[BODY — 0:05-0:45]**
Azruddin Mohamed was supposed to appear at Georgetown Magistrates' Court at 9 AM for his extradition hearing. By 9:05, Magistrate Latchman issued an arrest warrant. When Mohamed finally showed up at 9:35, he was handcuffed and taken to the lock-ups.

Mohamed says the PPP orchestrated the delay. The magistrate says she'll "temper justice with mercy." And the rest of us are just wondering — if court runs on this schedule, why can't NIS and GRA?

The extradition case continues tomorrow. Twenty-five-page federal indictment. Gold fraud, money laundering, millions in evaded taxes. But today, the headline is about punctuality.

## SCRIPT 2: 60-SECOND SHORT — "NCN Cameraman Brought a GUN to Court"

**[HOOK — 0:00-0:05]**
An NCN cameraman was arrested at Georgetown Magistrates' Court yesterday — with what appeared to be a FIREARM.

**[BODY — 0:05-0:45]**
Here's what we know. The cameraman was sent to cover the Mohamed extradition hearing. He'd only been working at NCN for a few months. He was NOT originally scheduled to be there. Kaieteur News reports he was instructed to attend by a senior government official.

After he finished recording, someone noticed what looked like a weapon in his waistband. He was arrested and taken to the police station.

Whether it was a real firearm or a replica — we don't know yet. But a government media employee showing up armed to an opposition leader's court hearing is a question that deserves more than a police statement.

## SCRIPT 3: 4-MINUTE VIDEO — "Hakeem Olajuwon is Selling Condos in Guyana"

**[HOOK — 0:00-0:15]**
NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem "The Dream" Olajuwon just launched a luxury condo development in Ogle, Guyana. Starting price: US$250,000. But there's a US$100,000 discount for Guyanese. Let's break down what this means.

**[SECTION 1: THE DEAL — 0:15-1:15]**
TAJ Dream Ogle is the second major project from Coastal Rim Properties in Guyana. Olajuwon is the co-developer.

The numbers: units start at US$250,000. But for the first 60 days, every Guyanese citizen — whether you're in Georgetown or Brooklyn — gets a US$100,000 discount. That's US$150,000 entry price.

Minister of Tourism Susan Rodrigues endorsed it. Olajuwon praised Guyana's "investor-friendly climate." The development aims to set "a new benchmark for international-quality residential living."

**[SECTION 2: WHO CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD THIS — 1:15-2:30]**
Let's be real. The average Guyanese salary is roughly GY$80,000 per month — about US$380. At US$150,000, you're looking at more than 30 years of saving every single dollar.

So who's the target? Diaspora Guyanese. Returning professionals. Foreign workers in the oil sector. Investors looking for rental income.

This is aspirational housing, not affordable housing. And that's okay — as long as we're honest about it.

The real question is whether developments like this push land prices even higher for everyone else. When luxury becomes the benchmark, what happens to the people just trying to build a simple house?

**[SECTION 3: WHAT IT SIGNALS — 2:30-3:30]**
Here's the bigger picture. When Hakeem Olajuwon puts his name — and his money — into Guyana, it sends a message internationally.

It says: Guyana is a real market. Guyana has stability. Guyana has growth potential that global investors notice.

Five years ago, nobody outside the Caribbean knew where Guyana was. Now an NBA legend is building condos there. That transformation is real, regardless of how you feel about the politics.

**[CTA — 3:30-4:00]**

## SCRIPT 4: 60-SECOND SHORT — "Guyana Energy Conference Opens Today"

**[HOOK — 0:00-0:05]**
Guyana's FIFTH Energy Conference opens today at the Marriott. And the announcements are BIG.

**[BODY — 0:05-0:45]**
The Tri-Star port is officially launching. President Ali wants deep-water port and Phase 2 gas decisions before the end of Q1. Brazil's Roraima governor is bringing a delegation to talk transshipment — Guyana positioned as the logistics gateway for northern Brazil.

Meanwhile, two new airport proposals dropped — Lethem and Rose Hall. A $20 billion training college just opened in Port Mourant. And telemedicine went from 4 sites to 130 in four years.

Love the government or hate them — the infrastructure pipeline is undeniable.

Guyana is building. The question is: who benefits? Subscribe for daily updates.
