I’m your host, and this is your Saturday news roundup — covering all four Guyanese newspapers so you don’t have to!\nGrab your coffee, grab your roti, and let’s get into it!”\n[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET \u0026 OPPOSITION LEADER — 0:20-1:30]\n[GRAPHIC: BUDGET 2026 / OPPOSITION LEADER VOTE]\n“Alright, Monday is going to be a BIG day in Guyana. Two major events happening.\nFirst — Budget 2026 presentation. Now, I’m not going to make any predictions, but… [leans in] it’s going to be the ’largest budget in Guyana’s history.’\nI know, I know — they say that EVERY year. But this year APNU actually raising some concerns. They saying with oil prices dropping, maybe government shouldn’t be borrowing so much. Quote: ‘Another largest budget would be a reckless gamble.’\nNow, APNU giving fiscal advice is a little bit like… well… let’s just say they didn’t exactly leave the treasury overflowing when they left office. But fair point about oil prices — that’s real.\n[Transition]\nSecond big Monday event — the Opposition Leader vote!\nAfter MONTHS of drama, we’re finally getting a vote on who will be Leader of the Opposition. Azruddin Mohamed from WIN party is the frontrunner, but here’s where it gets interesting…\nAPNU says they’re going to ABSTAIN. Not vote against him, not vote for him — just… not vote. They have 12 seats! And they’re choosing to sit this one out!\nKaieteur News reporting that Mohamed himself is ‘scared’ ahead of the vote. Scared of what, exactly? The vote? The responsibility? The US extradition case that’s still pending?\nThe Western diplomats apparently had an ‘interesting’ meeting with Speaker Nadir about all this. When diplomats call something ‘interesting,’ you KNOW there’s drama behind closed doors.”\n[SEGMENT 2: DEVELOPMENT NEWS — 1:30-2:20]\n[GRAPHIC: DEVELOPMENT ROUNDUP]\n“Let’s talk about some actual development news!\nBarama Company just invested ONE BILLION dollars to boost their plywood production. And they’re introducing waterproof plywood!\nNow, some people might laugh at plywood news, but think about it — Guyana floods every rainy season. Waterproof plywood? That’s not just smart business, that’s survival gear!\n[Transition]\nPresident Ali launched a shade house project in Georgetown. He called it ‘game-changing.’\nLook — when you hear ‘game-changing’ you might expect something massive. And yes, it’s basically fancy gardening. BUT… if it means cheaper vegetables, I’m here for it. Tomatoes costing more than steak these days.\n[Transition]\nMinister Edghill finally snapped about all the abandoned vehicles blocking roads everywhere. Quote: ‘TOTAL DISRESPECT NOW!’\nEvery neighborhood in Guyana has that one car sitting on blocks since the Hoyte administration. The bush growing through the windshield, chickens living in the backseat. Edghill says REMOVE THEM.\nWatch how many people suddenly find their car registration papers now!”\n[SEGMENT 3: INTERNATIONAL \u0026 CRIME — 2:20-3:10]\n[GRAPHIC: INTERNATIONAL NEWS]\n“Quick international hits!\nVenezuela’s interim government is overhauling their oil laws. Guyana watching closely, because whatever Venezuela does with oil affects what WE can negotiate. Or… you know… what Exxon tells us we can negotiate.\nTrump still trying to acquire Greenland. The man collecting territories like Pokémon cards! At this rate, he might come for Essequibo before Venezuela does!\n[Transition]\nAnd in crime news — INTERPOL busted a gold smuggling ring right here in Guyana.\nGold smuggling. In GUYANA. The country where gold is literally everywhere. The country where gold dealers are running for Opposition Leader.\nI am absolutely SHOCKED. Shocked, I tell you! Who could have predicted that people would try to illegally profit from gold in a gold-rich country?!”\n[SEGMENT 4: SPORTS \u0026 CLOSING — 3:10-4:00]\n[GRAPHIC: SPORTS]\n“Quick sports update — Guyana women’s cricket team beat Jamaica in the CWI Blaze T20 Championships! Skipper Shemaine Campbelle scored an unbeaten 50. Big up to the ladies!\nWest Indies preparing for their Afghanistan T20 series in Dubai ahead of the T20 World Cup. Let’s hope they show up and show OUT!\n[CLOSING]\n[AVATAR FULL SCREEN]\nAlright people, that’s your Saturday Brief!\nTo recap:\nBudget Monday — prepare for ’largest ever’ Opposition Leader vote Monday — prepare for drama Barama dropping billions — prepare for waterproof plywood Edghill removing derelict vehicles — prepare to move your cousin car The full written version with Uncle Ramesh’s pro-government response is on the website — link in the description.\nIf you enjoyed this, smash that subscribe button.
