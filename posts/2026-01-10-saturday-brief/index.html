According to their lawyer, Sanjeev Datadin, the US wants to extradite them because they’re “Indian Guyanese” and “successful businessmen.”\nLet’s Break This Down:\nTheir Argument: America is targeting them because of their ethnicity and success.\nReality: America is targeting them because Florida has an active criminal case against them for money laundering.\nThe Victim Narrative: “We’ve done nothing wrong! We’re being persecuted!”\nThe Court Record: Multiple appeals, all denied. Multiple judges, all said “no.” The pattern is clear.\nD LEGAL STRATEGY TRACKER:\nStrategy #1: \"We didn't do it\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #2: \"The evidence is weak\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #3: \"The process is unfair\" âŒ Failed\nStrategy #4: \"We're victims of discrimination\" â³ Current attempt\nKaieteur News (As Always): Has written enough about the Mohameds to fill a library. At this point, they could publish The Complete Mohamed Saga: Volumes 1-47.\nThe Timeline: Every time a court says no, they find a new reason to appeal. They’ve turned extradition into a marathon sport.\nâš¡ CONTRACTOR NEARLY KILLS HIMSELF (AND HALF OF GEORGETOWN) âš ï¸ CLOSE CALL ALERT âš ï¸\nPower Line Voltage: 69,000 volts\nCrane Proximity: Too close\nSafety Protocol Followed: Questionable\nOutcome: Everyone lived (somehow)\nA contractor working on Sheriff Street almost touched a 69,000-volt power line with his crane. Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.\nFor Context: That’s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No “oops, my bad.”\nWhat Happened:\nContractor lifting materials Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines GPL (Guyana Power \u0026 Light) technicians notice Emergency shutdown before catastrophe The Scary Part: This wasn’t discovered by the contractor. This wasn’t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.\nTranslation: Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren’t followed. And we only know about it because GPL’s people were alert.\nNSTRUCTION WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan â†’ Survey site â†’ Identify hazards â†’ Implement safety â†’ Execute\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) â†’ Start work â†’ Almost cause disaster â†’ Act surprised â†’ Blame someone else\nThe Questions Nobody’s Asking:\nWho approved this project without a proper safety plan? Why were the power lines not clearly marked? What happens to the contractor? The Answers: Probably nothing, probably nobody, and definitely “we’re looking into it.”\nSTATS: MURDER UP, ROAD DEATHS UP, VIBES DOWN RIME STATISTICS:\nMurders: UP 11% (134 total)\nRoad Deaths: UP 6% (140 total)\nGovernment Response: \"Crime is down!\"\nPublic: \"Please be serious.\" The police released 2025 crime statistics, and the numbers tell a story the government doesn’t want to hear.\nMurders: 134 (up from 121 in 2024) Road Deaths: 140 (up from 132 in 2024)\nGovernment’s Spin: “Overall crime is down! Look at the big picture!”\nThe Big Picture: More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That’s the picture.\nThe Breakdown:\nMurders: 11% increase Road deaths: 6% increase Combined: 274 lives lost What Actually Decreased: Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?\nSING CRIME:\nWhat Works: Community policing, better training, accountability, improved response times\nWhat We Got: \"Crime is down!\" (when it's actually up in the categories that matter most)\nM GUYANA: STILL STRUGGLING The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.\nIncident #1: French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.\nIncident #2: British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana “Third World.” Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.\nThe Pattern: When tourists show reality, we attack the tourists instead of fixing the reality.\n40,000 HOUSES PROMISE G MATH CHECK:\nPromise: 40,000 houses by 2028\nTime Remaining: ~3 years\nRequired Pace: 37 houses PER DAY\nCurrent Reality: Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.\nVice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government’s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.\nLet’s Do The Math:\n40,000 houses Ã· 3 years = 13,333 houses/year 13,333 houses Ã· 365 days = 36.5 houses PER DAY For Perspective: That’s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.\nCurrent Status: They’ve allocated land. Land allocation â‰ built houses.\nECTRICITY PROMISE (REMEMBER THAT?) Remember when they promised “no more blackouts” by end of 2024? It’s 2026. Still waiting.\nThe Pattern:\nMake bold promise Miss deadline Announce new timeline Repeat POSITION: STILL MISSING Where is the opposition? Seriously, where are they? The Mohamed case has Parliament frozen. No sessions, no debates, no oversight.\nDemocracy Requires: Active opposition holding government accountable\nWhat We Have: Silence\nGOOD NEWS: AISHALTON AIRSTRIP Finally, some genuinely good news! The Aishalton airstrip project is actually progressing well. On time, on budget, serving the community.\nProof: Infrastructure projects CAN work when properly managed.\nATURDAY RECAP E LEARNED:\nThe Mohameds are now victims (apparently) 69,000 volts is not a suggestion Murder is up, but \"crime is down\" Tourists with cameras remain public enemy #1 40,000 houses = 37/day (good luck) The electricity promise aged poorly The opposition is on permanent vacation Aishalton proves we CAN do things right Sunday: Rest. Monday: More chaos.\nSubscribe at guyanadailybrief.com to get this delivered by noon.\nTHE GUYANA BRIEF: Making Guyana’s news slightly more bearable, one satirical digest at a time.\n",

<p><strong>Kaieteur News (As Always):</strong> Has written enough about the Mohameds to fill a library. At this point, they could publish <em>The Complete Mohamed Saga: Volumes 1-47</em>.</p>

<hr style="border-color: #FFC107; margin: 15px 0;">
<p><strong>Power Line Voltage:</strong> 69,000 volts</p>
<p><strong>Crane Proximity:</strong> Too close</p>
<p><strong>Safety Protocol Followed:</strong> Questionable</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Everyone lived (somehow)</p>
</div>
<p>A contractor working on Sheriff Street almost touched a 69,000-volt power line with his crane. Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.</p>
<p><strong>For Context:</strong> That&rsquo;s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No &ldquo;oops, my bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contractor lifting materials</li>
<li>Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines</li>
<li>GPL (Guyana Power &amp; Light) technicians notice</li>
<li>Emergency shutdown before catastrophe</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Scary Part:</strong> This wasn&rsquo;t discovered by the contractor. This wasn&rsquo;t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren&rsquo;t followed. And we only know about it because GPL&rsquo;s people were alert.</p>

<p><strong>In Guyana:</strong> Plan (maybe) â†’ Start work â†’ Almost cause disaster â†’ Act surprised â†’ Blame someone else</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Questions Nobody&rsquo;s Asking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who approved this project without a proper safety plan?</li>
<li>Why were the power lines not clearly marked?</li>
<li>What happens to the contractor?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Answers:</strong> Probably nothing, probably nobody, and definitely &ldquo;we&rsquo;re looking into it.&rdquo;</p>

Road Deaths: UP 6% (140 total)<br>
Government Response: "Crime is down!"<br>
Public: "Please be serious."
</div>
<p>The police released 2025 crime statistics, and the numbers tell a story the government doesn&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>
<p><strong>Murders:</strong> 134 (up from 121 in 2024)
<strong>Road Deaths:</strong> 140 (up from 132 in 2024)</p>
<p><strong>Government&rsquo;s Spin:</strong> &ldquo;Overall crime is down! Look at the big picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture:</strong> More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That&rsquo;s the picture.</p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Murders: 11% increase</li>
<li>Road deaths: 6% increase</li>
<li>Combined: 274 lives lost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Actually Decreased:</strong> Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?</p>

<p>The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.</p>
<p><strong>Incident #1:</strong> French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.</p>
<p><strong>Incident #2:</strong> British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana &ldquo;Third World.&rdquo; Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.</p>

<p><strong>Promise:</strong> 40,000 houses by 2028</p>
<p><strong>Time Remaining:</strong> ~3 years</p>
<p><strong>Required Pace:</strong> 37 houses PER DAY</p>
<p><strong>Current Reality:</strong> Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.</p>
</div>
<p>Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government&rsquo;s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s Do The Math:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>40,000 houses Ã· 3 years = 13,333 houses/year</li>
<li>13,333 houses Ã· 365 days = <strong>36.5 houses PER DAY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Perspective:</strong> That&rsquo;s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.</p>
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong> They&rsquo;ve allocated land. Land allocation â‰  built houses.</p>
