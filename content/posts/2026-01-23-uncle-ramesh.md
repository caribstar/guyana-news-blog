## 🇺🇸 AMBASSADOR THERIOT IS A SMART WOMAN

Now look, the US Ambassador get asked about Speaker Nadir comments, and what she say? "I don't feel like he targeted us. I think he was simply expressing his opinion which he has a right to do."

THIS IS HOW DIPLOMACY SUPPOSED TO WORK!

She not jumping in we business. She not taking sides. She acknowledging that the Speaker is a grown man with a constitutional role who can speak his mind.

You know what some people wanted her to say? They wanted her to criticize the Speaker. They wanted international pressure. They wanted the US to interfere in we Parliament business.

But Ambassador Theriot too smart for that. She know Guyana is a sovereign nation. She know we have we own democratic processes. And she respectful enough to stay out of it.

**Me nephew ask me:** "Uncle, but she didn't support the Speaker either!"

Boy, that's the POINT. She not supposed to support OR oppose. She supposed to respect that Guyana handle Guyana business. And that's exactly what she doing.

*Classy. Professional. Proper diplomacy.*

## ✊ APAD PUTTING COUNTRY FIRST

Now THIS is what I like to see!

The Association of People of African Descent — an organization that nobody would call "pro-PPP" — come out and say the opposition shouldn't elect someone facing criminal charges in the US as Opposition Leader.

Read that again. APAD. Saying this.

They talking about constitutional responsibility. They talking about "long-term national interest." They talking about Guyana's forward trajectory.

This is NOT a PPP statement. This is NOT a government position. This is civil society — African diaspora civil society — saying "hold on, think about what you doing."

When Speaker Nadir said it, some people say "Oh, he partisan."

When Kit Nascimento said it, some people say "Oh, he government friendly."

When Shurwayne Holder said it, some people say "Oh, he bitter."

But APAD? What excuse you have for APAD?

**The truth is:** People across the political spectrum seeing the same thing. You can't spend years talking about anti-corruption and then elect someone under indictment. That's not how credibility work.

I hope the opposition MPs listen. For once, put Guyana first.

## 🚢 RIVER CRUISES = REAL TOURISM DEVELOPMENT

Minister Rodrigues take a cruise on the Demerara River and people want to make joke?

Let me explain something to the critics: THIS IS WHAT TOURISM DIVERSIFICATION LOOK LIKE.

The "One Freedom" cruise ship got:
- 46 rooms with their own bathroom
- A gym
- Full kitchen and bar
- Atlantic Ocean access

You know what this mean? It mean Guyana moving from "you can see Kaieteur and go home" to "you can have a full tourism experience."

River cruises is BIG BUSINESS in places like the Amazon, the Nile, the Mekong. Why not the Demerara? Why not the Essequibo? We got some of the most untouched riverways in the world!

**Me wife ask me:** "But Ramesh, you think people coming to Guyana for cruise?"

Listen, five years ago nobody was thinking about Guyana as eco-tourism destination. Now we winning international awards. Five years ago nobody was thinking about Georgetown as conference destination. Now we hosting CARICOM and international meetings.

Things CHANGE when you INVEST in development. The Minister doing her job — assessing opportunities, building partnerships, diversifying the product.

*That's called vision. Try it sometime.*

## 💡 FIBRE OPTICS TRAINING = JOBS

200 Guyanese trained in fibre optics. 130 sponsored by the government through BIT.

You know what this is? This is the government INVESTING in the workforce for the new economy.

Every ISP need fibre optic technicians. The oil and gas sector need them. The tech sector need them. And now we have 200 certified Guyanese ready to fill those jobs.

This is how you do it:
1. Identify the skills gap
2. Partner with training providers
3. SPONSOR the training for Guyanese
4. Watch the workforce grow

Not everything need to be a big headline. Sometimes development is 30 people at a time getting certified, going out, getting jobs, supporting their families.

That's REAL progress.

## 🏫 ABOUT THAT SCHOOL...

Yes, the opposition went to Tabatinga and found four workers. You know what else in Tabatinga? A school being built where there wasn't one before.

I not saying the construction pace good. I not saying they shouldn't ask questions. But let's remember:

- This is hinterland construction
- Materials have to be transported to Region 9
- Soil conditions are challenging  
- Weather is unpredictable

The contractor explained the challenges. The government said they monitoring. The school will get built.

You know what the opposition DIDN'T have between 2015-2020? A $182 million secondary school project for Tabatinga. So yes, ask questions about the pace. But don't forget who actually putting the money there.

## 🎯 UNCLE RAMESH BOTTOM LINE

This weekend, I grateful for:

✅ An American Ambassador who respect Guyana sovereignty

✅ Civil society groups putting country over party

✅ A government diversifying tourism with river cruises

✅ 200 young Guyanese with new technical certifications

✅ Infrastructure projects happening even in the hinterland

Is everything perfect? No. Is Guyana moving forward? ABSOLUTELY.

Have a blessed weekend, family. Hug your children. Call your mother. And remember — development is a marathon, not a sprint.

From Queens with love,

**Uncle Ramesh** 🇬🇾
