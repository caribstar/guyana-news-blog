## 🇺🇸 US AMBASSADOR: "HE CAN HAVE HIS OPINION"

US Ambassador Nicole Theriot was asked about Speaker Nadir's recent comments defending Parliament and criticizing claims that the National Assembly has been "non-functioning." Her response? Peak diplomatic non-commitment.

"I don't feel like he targeted us. I think he was simply expressing his opinion which he has a right to do," Theriot told reporters on Thursday.

**Translation:** "We're staying out of this one."

The Speaker, you'll recall, had defended the 13th Parliament while also taking a subtle jab at some diplomats whose comments he said contributed to perceptions that Parliament was inactive. He thanked the diplomatic community for their historic support of democracy in Guyana, but suggested some positions were "misinformed."

The Ambassador's response is the diplomatic equivalent of "no comment" wrapped in a polite smile. She's not agreeing, she's not disagreeing — she's just acknowledging he has a mouth and can use it.

*Smart woman.*

## ⚠️ APAD: "DON'T DO IT"

The Association of People of African Descent (APAD) has joined the growing chorus warning opposition MPs against electing Azruddin Mohamed as Opposition Leader.

In a statement released today, APAD noted that Mohamed "is the subject of criminal charges in the United States, including allegations relating to gold smuggling and tax evasion."

Their key argument? The Leader of the Opposition isn't just a party position — it's a constitutional office with real power over appointments and democratic oversight.

"Guyana is at a pivotal moment in its history," APAD wrote. "Decisions taken now must reinforce that forward trajectory, not cast uncertainty over it."

They urged opposition MPs to "place country above faction, and long-term national interest above short-term political convenience."

**The scorecard so far:**
- Speaker Nadir: Don't do it
- Kit Nascimento: Don't do it  
- Shurwayne Holder: Don't do it
- APAD: Don't do it
- WIN: *fingers in ears* "LA LA LA CAN'T HEAR YOU"

The opposition MPs are scheduled to meet Monday to elect their leader. Stay tuned.

## 🚢 MINISTER TAKES A CRUISE (FOR WORK, ALLEGEDLY)

Minister of Tourism Susan Rodrigues had a rough Wednesday — she had to take a cruise on the Demerara River and out into the Atlantic Ocean.

The "One Freedom" — also known as the Guyana Glory Passenger Cruise Ship — was the vessel in question. The Ministry says Rodrigues was conducting a "preliminary assessment" to explore opportunities for river-based tourism.

**The ship's specs:**
- 46 self-contained, double-occupancy rooms
- Full-service kitchen and bar
- Gym
- Open deck space
- Atlantic Ocean access

The engagement focused on packaging river tourism experiences and connecting travel trade with local tour operators.

Look, if someone has to test whether cruise ships on the Demerara River are viable tourism products, it might as well be the Tourism Minister. That's just good governance. 

*Someone had to sacrifice themselves for the GDP.*

## 💡 200+ GUYANESE NOW CERTIFIED IN FIBRE OPTICS

The Rehoboth Workforce Development Centre, in partnership with the Board of Industrial Training (BIT), has trained over 200 Guyanese in fibre optics since 2022.

CEO Sherissa Phillips told the Chronicle that the programme addresses a critical skills gap — every major ISP in Guyana now uses fibre-optic infrastructure, but there wasn't enough trained labour to support expansion.

**The numbers:**
- 200+ trained since 2022
- 130 sponsored by BIT
- USD $1,200 per person for certification
- 40 contact hours over 4-6 weeks

"From 2021, the Board of Industrial Training did approximately two cohorts, coming up to about 30 persons being trained," Phillips said. "Fast forward to 2026, we would have trained a total of 130 persons in partnership with BIT."

The centre plans to expand into other technical training areas as Guyana's development continues.

*Finally, people who can fix the internet when it goes down at 8pm on a Friday.*

## 🏫 OPPOSITION VISITS SCHOOL, FINDS 4 WORKERS

APNU and WIN MPs visited the Tabatinga Secondary School construction site and found... four workers.

The $182 million project, awarded to QA Civil Works in October 2024, was supposed to help with overcrowding at St. Ignatius Secondary School. But according to APNU MP Sherod Duncan, the school is "far from operational readiness."

"Roofing and flooring works were incomplete, key internal finishes remained outstanding, and only four workmen were observed on site," Duncan reported.

The opposition is questioning "project pacing, supervision, and the realism of the stated completion timeline."

The contractor has previously cited challenges including adverse weather, complex soil type, and difficulties transporting materials to the region.

WIN also noted the access road to the school remains unpaved, causing excessive dust — and this road also serves as the main access to the Rupununi Rodeo Grounds.

*Four workers for a $182M project. At that rate, the building will be ready just in time for the students' grandchildren.*

## 📊 QUICK HITS

**Bayrock Stadium opens January 31:** The long-awaited $179M track and field facility in Linden is finally ready. Sports Ministers Ramson and Jacobs inspected the site last weekend. Features include a synthetic track, football field, and spectator stands.

**West Indies vs Afghanistan:** CWI announced a 16-member squad for the three-match T20I series in Dubai, tuning up for the February 7 World Cup.

**China-Guyana Friendship Park:** The project near the new Demerara Harbour Bridge is now expected to complete by January 26. Features include a children's play zone, trampoline area, outdoor theatre, and sports courts.

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

The US Ambassador is staying diplomatically neutral on Parliament drama. APAD is warning against electing a US-indicted leader. The Tourism Minister is cruising (for research). And somewhere in Tabatinga, four brave workers are building an entire secondary school.

It's Friday in Guyana, and we're heading into the weekend with the opposition leader question still unresolved. Monday's meeting should be interesting.

*Have a good weekend. Try not to get indicted.*
