  "articleBody": "Uncle Ramesh settles into his chair with the census report and a smile\nBai, Uncle Ramesh See De Vision Now So everybody complaining about de census data, saying government build too much house. Uncle Ramesh was confused at first, but den he think about it proper.\nHere’s what Uncle Ramesh realize: Between 2012 and 2022:\nPopulation grow by 131,719 people Government build 92,233 new structures Each structure hold about 3.23 people Now de critics say “Dat’s space for 300,000 people! Dat’s TWICE what you need!”\nBut Uncle Ramesh ask: You rather government build LESS and den everybody complaining dey can’t get house lot? You rather we have ACTUAL housing shortage?\nUncle Ramesh remember de days when people wait 10-15 YEARS for house lot. Now government give out lots like Christmas presents, and people STILL complaining!\nUncle Ramesh translation: Government plan AHEAD instead of reacting AFTER. Dat’s called VISION, people!\nDe Infrastructure Will Catch Up Critics saying “But de lots ain’t got power and water!”\nUncle Ramesh say: Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is infrastructure!\nDe reality:\nGPL working on expanding capacity Wales Gas-to-Energy coming (yes, it delayed, but it COMING) Water projects ongoing Roads being built You can’t install power lines BEFORE you allocate de land. Government doing things in ORDER. First give people de land, den build de infrastructure. Dat’s how development works!\nUncle Ramesh notice: When government DON’T give out house lots, people complain. When government DO give out house lots, people STILL complain. Can’t win!\nFinally Some People Going to Court Uncle Ramesh VERY happy to see de criminal court backlog easing. 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from way more before.\nBig cases finally getting heard:\n2012 schoolboy murder Shonette Dover case Scores of rape charges Uncle Ramesh say: Justice delayed is justice denied, yes. But justice HAPPENING is better than justice NEVER happening. Progress is progress!\nAnd de DPP saying backlog been dropping for FIVE YEARS straight. Dat mean government investment in judiciary WORKING.\nDe AG Got a Point Uncle Ramesh see everybody criticizing AG Nandlall for blasting de magistrates. But Uncle Ramesh ask: If you pass modern laws and courts ain’t using them, whose fault is that?\nGovernment pass legislation to help people. Courts supposed to APPLY the legislation. If courts ignoring de laws, somebody need to speak up!\nUncle Ramesh think: Maybe if courts actually USE de laws Parliament pass, AG won’t need to publicly remind them. Just saying.\nGuyanese Leading Regional Organizations Muhammad Ibrahim taking over as Director-General of IICA today. Dat’s a GUYANESE leading a major regional agricultural body!\nUncle Ramesh remember when Guyana was de poor relative in de Caribbean. Now:\nWe running regional organizations We leading in oil production We fastest-growing economy in de world Uncle Ramesh proud! When last time you see small Guyana punching above its weight like this? Answer: NOW.\nDe Cybercrime Law Working As Intended People crying about Stanley Basdeo getting arrested for cybercrime. Uncle Ramesh say: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!\nYou can’t go on social media making wild accusations, attacking people character, spreading misinformation, and den cry “free speech!” when police knock on you door.\nDe law apply to EVERYBODY. You want to criticize government? Fine! Do it RESPONSIBLY. Don’t make up stories, don’t defame people, don’t spread lies.\nUncle Ramesh notice de same people defending Basdeo would be FIRST to call for jail if somebody attack THEM online. Funny how that works.\nPresident Protecting National Interests Critics vex that President Ali won’t give details about de third-country nationals deal. Uncle Ramesh ask: Since when government supposed to negotiate international agreements in PUBLIC?\nYou negotiate in PRIVATE, den announce when deal is DONE. Dat’s how diplomacy works! You think USA announce every detail while they negotiating? You think China tweet their strategy?\nUncle Ramesh say: Let de government do their job. When de deal ready, they will announce it. Until den, stop demanding classified information like you work for de State Department.\nAirfares Dropping Because Government Delivered Uncle Ramesh LOVE this one. Government rehabilitate airstrips, and immediately:\nTrans Guyana drop fares 7% Air Services drop fares 9% Roraima drop fares too Dis is de free market RESPONDING to government investment! Government fix de infrastructure, private sector benefit, PEOPLE benefit.\nUncle Ramesh ask de critics: When last time opposition fix a airstrip? Uncle Ramesh will wait…\nStill waiting…\nExactly.\nParliament Will Resume When Ready EU and UK ambassadors calling for Parliament to resume. Uncle Ramesh think: Mind your business!\nGuyana is a sovereign nation. We will run OUR Parliament on OUR timeline. If we need advice on how to run democracy, Uncle Ramesh will look at countries that DIDN’T colonize half de world.\nDe truth: Opposition walking out, not cooperating, playing politics instead of governing. When they ready to behave like adults, Parliament will resume.\nUncle Ramesh notice these same ambassadors quiet when opposition was disrupting Parliament. Now dey want to talk? Please.\nUncle Ramesh’s Bottom Line Census show government planning AHEAD with housing (good strategy!). Courts finally clearing backlog after years of government investment (progress!). Guyanese leading regional organizations (national pride!). Airfares dropping because government delivered on infrastructure (results!).\nDe pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing: Government making long-term investments, critics want instant results, and when results COME, critics find something else to complain about.\nUncle Ramesh prefer it this way: Build first, explain later. Results speak louder than press conferences.\nIs everything perfect? No! But show Uncle Ramesh ANY country where everything perfect. Uncle Ramesh will wait…\nStill waiting…\nExactly.\nUncle Ramesh going back to enjoying he census data. At least when government do math, dey planning for GROWTH instead of DECLINE. Dat’s leadership!\n🇬🇾 Keep building, Guyana. De critics will always criticize. De builders will always build.\n*Reading the Other Side: De critics will say government overbuilding, cybercrime law being abused, and Parliament dysfunction. Read de Wednesday Brief for dat perspective if you want to be negative all de time.\nUncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary and don’t represent actual persons. But de progress? De progress REAL.*\n",

<p>So everybody complaining about de census data, saying government build too much house. Uncle Ramesh was confused at first, but den he think about it proper.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what Uncle Ramesh realize:</strong> Between 2012 and 2022:</p>

<li>Population grow by 131,719 people</li>
<li>Government build 92,233 new structures</li>
<li>Each structure hold about 3.23 people</li>

<p>Now de critics say &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s space for 300,000 people! Dat&rsquo;s TWICE what you need!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>De reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GPL working on expanding capacity</li>
<li>Wales Gas-to-Energy coming (yes, it delayed, but it COMING)</li>
<li>Water projects ongoing</li>

<p>Uncle Ramesh VERY happy to see de criminal court backlog easing. 126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from way more before.</p>
<p><strong>Big cases finally getting heard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2012 schoolboy murder</li>
<li>Shonette Dover case</li>
<li>Scores of rape charges</li>

<h2 id="de-cybercrime-law-working-as-intended">De Cybercrime Law Working As Intended<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#de-cybercrime-law-working-as-intended">#</a></h2>
<p>People crying about Stanley Basdeo getting arrested for cybercrime. Uncle Ramesh say: <strong>Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!</strong></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go on social media making wild accusations, attacking people character, spreading misinformation, and den cry &ldquo;free speech!&rdquo; when police knock on you door.</p>
<p><strong>De law apply to EVERYBODY.</strong> You want to criticize government? Fine! Do it RESPONSIBLY. Don&rsquo;t make up stories, don&rsquo;t defame people, don&rsquo;t spread lies.</p>
<p>Uncle Ramesh notice de same people defending Basdeo would be FIRST to call for jail if somebody attack THEM online. Funny how that works.</p>

<h2 id="president-protecting-national-interests">President Protecting National Interests<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#president-protecting-national-interests">#</a></h2>
<p>Critics vex that President Ali won&rsquo;t give details about de third-country nationals deal. Uncle Ramesh ask: <strong>Since when government supposed to negotiate international agreements in PUBLIC?</strong></p>
<p>You negotiate in PRIVATE, den announce when deal is DONE. Dat&rsquo;s how diplomacy works! You think USA announce every detail while they negotiating? You think China tweet their strategy?</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh say:</strong> Let de government do their job. When de deal ready, they will announce it. Until den, stop demanding classified information like you work for de State Department.</p>

<h2 id="airfares-dropping-because-government-delivered">Airfares Dropping Because Government Delivered<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#airfares-dropping-because-government-delivered">#</a></h2>
<p>Uncle Ramesh LOVE this one. Government rehabilitate airstrips, and immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trans Guyana drop fares 7%</li>
<li>Air Services drop fares 9%</li>
<li>Roraima drop fares too</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dis is de free market RESPONDING to government investment!</strong> Government fix de infrastructure, private sector benefit, PEOPLE benefit.</p>
<p>Uncle Ramesh ask de critics: <strong>When last time opposition fix a airstrip?</strong> Uncle Ramesh will wait&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Still waiting&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong>Exactly.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="parliament-will-resume-when-ready">Parliament Will Resume When Ready<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#parliament-will-resume-when-ready">#</a></h2>
<p>EU and UK ambassadors calling for Parliament to resume. Uncle Ramesh think: <strong>Mind your business!</strong></p>
<p>Guyana is a sovereign nation. We will run OUR Parliament on OUR timeline. If we need advice on how to run democracy, Uncle Ramesh will look at countries that DIDN&rsquo;T colonize half de world.</p>
<p><strong>De truth:</strong> Opposition walking out, not cooperating, playing politics instead of governing. When they ready to behave like adults, Parliament will resume.</p>
<p>Uncle Ramesh notice these same ambassadors quiet when opposition was disrupting Parliament. Now dey want to talk? Please.</p>

<h2 id="uncle-rameshs-bottom-line">Uncle Ramesh&rsquo;s Bottom Line<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#uncle-rameshs-bottom-line">#</a></h2>
<p>Census show government planning AHEAD with housing (good strategy!). Courts finally clearing backlog after years of government investment (progress!). Guyanese leading regional organizations (national pride!). Airfares dropping because government delivered on infrastructure (results!).</p>
<p><strong>De pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing:</strong> Government making long-term investments, critics want instant results, and when results COME, critics find something else to complain about.</p>
<p>Uncle Ramesh prefer it this way: <strong>Build first, explain later. Results speak louder than press conferences.</strong></p>
<p>Is everything perfect? No! But show Uncle Ramesh ANY country where everything perfect. Uncle Ramesh will wait&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Still waiting&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong>Exactly.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Uncle Ramesh going back to enjoying he census data. At least when government do math, dey planning for GROWTH instead of DECLINE. Dat&rsquo;s leadership!</em></p>
<p>🇬🇾 <strong>Keep building, Guyana. De critics will always criticize. De builders will always build.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>*<strong>Reading the Other Side:</strong> De critics will say government overbuilding, cybercrime law being abused, and Parliament dysfunction. Read de Wednesday Brief for dat perspective if you want to be negative all de time.</p>
<p>Uncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary and don&rsquo;t represent actual persons. But de progress? De progress REAL.*</p>
