## 60-SECOND HEYGEN SCRIPT

Good morning Guyana! Here's your Monday brief in sixty seconds.

Christopher Ram is asking tough questions about the Auditor General. With public spending in the trillions, billions remain unaudited, and the AG is asking for a two-year extension. Ram calls the framework "structurally incapable of producing independence." Ouch.

Seventy-seven Cuban nationals have been screened for suspected human trafficking. Cuba's humanitarian crisis is driving desperate migration, and Guyana appears to be on the route.

Over in Linden, President Ali opened the Bayroc National Stadium on Saturday. Linden's first national-standard sporting facility. Say what you want — that's progress you can touch.

The Gas-to-Energy project gets another ten point seven billion dollars in the twenty twenty-six budget. Total spent so far: two hundred and fifty-eight billion. The government says electricity by Q4. We'll see.

And the BIG story: Shimron Hetmyer smashed the fastest West Indies fifty in T20 World Cup history — twenty-two balls — while Romario Shepherd took five wickets including a hat-trick. Two Guyanese superstars lighting up Eden Gardens!

## 4-MINUTE HEYGEN SCRIPT

Good morning Guyana and the diaspora! It's Monday, February 9th, twenty twenty-six, and I'm here with your Daily Brief. We've got a LOT to cover today, from budget drama to World Cup heroics.

Let's start with the story that's going to dominate the week. Christopher Ram — chartered accountant, attorney, and the man who keeps the government up at night — published a devastating column questioning the independence of Auditor General Deodat Sharma. Here's the situation: public spending has exploded into the trillions. The AG's office is supposed to audit that spending. But Ram says billions remain unaudited, and the AG has applied for a two-year extension of his tenure — from the very executive he's supposed to be checking.

Ram's exact words: "The framework is structurally incapable of producing independence." When the person who checks the government's receipts has to ask the government for a job extension, you can see the problem. Now, government supporters will say Ram is a known critic. That's true. But the question remains: where are the audits?

Moving to a deeply concerning story — seventy-seven Cuban nationals have been screened in connection with suspected human trafficking. Cuba is in full humanitarian crisis mode. The US has branded the island an "extraordinary threat," Venezuelan oil shipments have stopped, and Mexico faces tariff threats if it supplies fuel. Cubans are increasingly desperate, and Guyana may be becoming a transit route. The fact that authorities caught this is good. The fact that it's happening at all is alarming.

In housing news, more than twenty homes were bulldozed in Circuitville. Details are thin, but affected families are asking where they're supposed to go. The government frames this as land reclamation. The families frame it as losing their homes. Both perspectives deserve attention.

Now for the parliamentary drama that only Guyana could produce. During Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed's maiden budget speech, PPP/C MPs repeatedly interrupted him for... reading his speech. Standing Orders technically prohibit reading verbatim but allow notes. Kaieteur's editorial called the rule "archaic." The Chronicle called Mohamed the worst opposition leader in history. The truth, as always, is somewhere in between. But the real loser here is the public, because the substance of the budget debate got buried under procedural bickering.

On the development front, some genuinely good news. President Ali opened the Bayroc National Stadium in Linden on Saturday — the town's first-ever national-standard sporting facility. Attorney General Nandlall announced that construction of Guyana's first law school will begin this year on eight acres at UG campus. And the Education Ministry is using World Bank financing for a secondary school dropout prevention system. These are real, tangible investments in Guyana's future.

The Gas-to-Energy saga continues. Ten point seven billion more in the twenty twenty-six budget, bringing total investment to two hundred and fifty-eight billion. PM Phillips says electricity by Q4. Kaieteur says missed deadlines. I say: let's revisit this in December and see who's right.

And now for the story that made every Guyanese chest swell with pride. The T20 World Cup opened on Saturday, and TWO Guyanese stars dominated. Shimron Hetmyer from Cumberland, Mahaica-Berbice, smashed sixty-four runs off thirty-six balls, including the FASTEST fifty by a West Indian in World Cup history — just twenty-two balls, breaking Chris Gayle's record from two thousand and nine. Then Romario Shepherd from Lethem — that's interior Guyana — took five wickets for twenty runs, including a HAT-TRICK and four wickets in five balls. West Indies beat Scotland by thirty-five runs. Two Guyanese. World stage. History made.

Next up: West Indies versus England on February eleven. Set your alarms.

Quick regional notes: Barbados goes to the polls on Wednesday with Mottley seeking a third term. Jamaica's IMF four hundred and fifteen million dollar deal is moving forward. And Trinidad's PM will address Caribbean Energy Week amid rising US military presence in the Caribbean Sea.
