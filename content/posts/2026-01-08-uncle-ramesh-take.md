# CLE RAMESH'S HOT TAKE

**Thursday, January 8, 2026**

---

*[Uncle Ramesh reading THE GUYANA BRIEF on his iPad, coffee in hand, shaking his head so hard his reading glasses almost fall off]*

---

Listen nah, I just read this youngin's "Guyana Brief" and my blood pressure went UP.

This child writing like Trump is some kinda superhero! "Uber-kidnapped a president!" Like is a GOOD thing?!

Let Uncle Ramesh school you on what REALLY happening here.

---

## ISE PARTY"? YOU MEAN INTERNATIONAL CRIME!

The Brief says: *"Americans just Uber-kidnapped an entire president!"*

**Uncle Ramesh says:** That's called INVASION, child! Not DoorDash! Not cute! Not funny!

This youngin' making JOKES about America bombing another country? About 80+ people DEAD? Where your humanity at?

**The Reality:**
- America BOMBED Venezuelan soil
- KILLED over 80 people
- KIDNAPPED a sitting president
- Put warships in Caribbean waters

And this child writing "faster than DoorDash"?! **NAH!**

---

## 'S RESPONSE AIN'T "THRILLED"

The Brief says: *"Ali is diplomatically thrilled"*

**Uncle Ramesh says:** Ali SCARED! Not thrilled! SCARED!

You think President Ali HAPPY about this? America just showed they could do the SAME THING to Guyana tomorrow if they feel like it!

**What Ali Actually Thinking:**
- "Please don't invade us next"
- "We got oil too, remember?"
- "Maybe I should call China... or Brazil... or SOMEBODY"

This ain't celebration time! This is WORRY time!

**The Protesters Got It Right:**
They outside the US Embassy saying "Guyana could be next!" And they RIGHT! We got 11 BILLION barrels of oil! You think America forget that?!

---

## HAMEDS: FINALLY WE AGREE (KINDA)

Okay, okay. Let Uncle Ramesh be fair (for ONCE).

The youngin' got THIS part right: The Mohameds need to STOP with the appeals.

**But here's what The Brief MISSED:**
- WHO put them in business for 40 YEARS?
- WHO gave them all those gold licenses?
- WHO looked the other way while they built an empire?

You can't complain about the Mohameds NOW when everybody KNEW what they was doing for DECADES!

**Uncle Ramesh's Theory:**
Mohameds thought they could wait out the Americans in Trinidad. Realized Georgetown food taste better. Came back. Now surprised the Americans still want them.

*shocked Pikachu face* 

---

## OES HIGHWAY: THE BRIEF GOT THIS WRONG

The Brief says: *"Highway lasted 13 months"*

**Uncle Ramesh says:** The highway WORKS! It just BUMPY!

Listen, y'all expect concrete to be PERFECT immediately? Concrete take TIME to settle! This is NORMAL!

**Here in Queens:**
We have roads that need work after 2-3 years TOO! But we don't write satirical articles about it!

**The Real Problem:**
Not that they fixing it. The problem is they LYING about "always planning" to put asphalt. Just ADMIT y'all made a mistake and moving on!

But noooo, government gotta PRETEND everything was planned. That's the REAL issue!

---

## CHOOL: THIS CHILD MISSED THE POINT COMPLETELY

The Brief says: *"Achievement is that internet didn't crash"*

**Uncle Ramesh says:** YOU MISSING THE POINT!

This ain't about Zoom working! This is about REACHING INTERIOR KIDS!

**What The Brief Ignored:**
- Dora Secondary (interior)
- Kwakwani (interior)  
- St. Cuthbert's (interior)
- Anna Regina (not Georgetown!)

These kids FINALLY getting same education as Georgetown kids! That's the WIN!

But no, this youngin' wanna make jokes about "Zoom been around since 2020."

**Yeah?** Well Zoom been in GEORGETOWN since 2020! Interior just getting it NOW! That's PROGRESS!

---

## ARMERS: THE BRIEF COMPLETELY MISSED IT

The Brief says: *"Money after damage done"*

**Uncle Ramesh says:** At least they GETTING money!

You know how many countries DON'T help farmers after floods? MOST OF THEM!

**The Real Cycle:**
1. Climate change causing worse floods (not Guyana's fault!)
2. Drainage systems can't handle it (needs MORE money to fix!)
3. Crops get damaged
4. Government helps farmers recover

**What You Want?** Government to time-travel and PREVENT floods? Control the weather?!

**Better Angle:**
Why The Brief ain't asking: "Where the DRAINAGE money going?" Now THAT'S the question!

---

## HE BRIEF REALLY MISSED

Let Uncle Ramesh tell you what THIS youngin' IGNORED in he satirical digest:

### **1. The Monroe Doctrine**
America just invoked the Monroe Doctrine! You know what that is, child? That's America saying "Latin America is OURS!"

This ain't just about Maduro! This is about REGIONAL CONTROL!

### **2. Guyana's Silence**
Why Ali ain't condemn the bombing? Because he CAN'T! America is Guyana's ally against Venezuela's territorial claims!

This is COMPLICATED! Not "DoorDash" jokes!

### **3. The Oil Factor**
Venezuela has oil. Guyana has oil. Trump wants control. Connect the dots, people!

### **4. CARICOM's Silence**
Where the REST of the Caribbean? Why NOBODY saying nothing? Because EVERYBODY scared!

---

## RAMESH'S REAL TALK

Look, I understand satire. I GET jokes. But sometimes the situation too SERIOUS for "Uber-kidnapped" jokes.

**What Really Happened:**
- American imperialism showed its face
- Guyana caught between rock and hard place
- Region scared to speak up
- Oil driving ALL of this

**The Brief's Take:**
- "DoorDash efficiency!"
- "Ali is thrilled!"
- Completely miss the GRAVITY

---

## WORD FROM QUEENS

This youngin' need to understand something: COMEDY GOT LIMITS.

When 80+ people dead, when democracy violated, when international law BROKEâ€”maybe don't lead with jokes about delivery apps?

**Messages for The Guyana Brief:**

**On Trump's Venezuela Move:**
This ain't comedy. This is CRISIS. Guyana need to be WORRIED, not making DoorDash comparisons.

**On The Mohameds:**
Finally we agree! But ask WHY they got this far in the first place!

**On Heroes Highway:**
You RIGHT that government lying. But the highway WORKS. It just needs adjustment.

**On Digital School:**
Celebrate the interior kids getting access! Stop being CYNICAL about everything!

**On Rice Farmers:**
At least government HELPING! Ask about PREVENTION, not mock the relief!

---

## RAMESH'S COUNTER-BRIEF

**What We ACTUALLY Learned Thursday:**

1. âœ… America willing to invade neighbors (SERIOUS)
2. âœ… Guyana's oil makes us vulnerable (WORRYING)
3. âœ… Mohameds still appealing (we agree!)
4. âœ… Government lies about "plans" (annoying but normal)
