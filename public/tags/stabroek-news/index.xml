&lt;p>Welcome to Sunday, where we pour one out for Stabroek News, the government pretends to be sad about it, and the entire Kingston Wharf has been commandeered so oil executives can park their yachts. Sorry, &amp;ldquo;exhibitors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today&amp;rsquo;s menu:&lt;/strong> A 39-year-old newspaper dies and everybody has an opinion, the Energy Conference takes over Georgetown&amp;rsquo;s waterfront, and the Budget debate continues to prove that Parliament is where good ideas go to get shouted at.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Daily Brief – February 14, 2026</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-14-daily-brief/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-14-daily-brief/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Happy Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, Guyana.

Parent company Guyana Publications Inc. (GPI) is entering voluntary liquidation. Chairman Brendan de Caires blamed global digital disruption — print advertising dropped 75% worldwide since 2004, and apparently even Guyana isn&amp;rsquo;t immune to people getting their news from WhatsApp forwards and TikTok videos of people falling off things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>☕ The Daily Brief – Friday, February 13, 2026</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-13-daily-brief/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-13-daily-brief/</guid><description>Stabroek News announces closure after 39 years.
