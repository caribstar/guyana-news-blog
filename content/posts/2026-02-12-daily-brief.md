## The Big Story: SOCU Descends On Lombard Street Like Is D-Day

Twenty Special Organised Crime Unit officers. One sniffer dog. A building on Lombard Street that has been **closed since 2024**.

And what did they find? Less than $2 million in cash and some documents.

Let we put this in perspective. Twenty armed officers could not find twenty million dollars. They found less money than what most Guyanese keep in their mattress for emergency.

Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed, whose family owns the building, said the raid is political retaliation for his Parliament speech last week where he told the nation he once "bankrolled" the PPP to the tune of hundreds of millions. The government says it was "credible intelligence" about illegal cambio operations.

Here is what we know for sure: Mohamed is US-sanctioned, US-indicted, facing extradition, and his businesses have been shut down by the government. So SOCU raided... a closed building. With twenty officers. And a dog.

Mohamed told the search party: *"All the money I give PPP deh at Freedom House. Go there and search."*

Nobody went to Freedom House.

The PPP, when asked about Mohamed's claims of bankrolling the party with hundreds of millions, has maintained a dignified silence. Jagdeo's phone going to voicemail. Ali's phone going to voicemail. Freedom House quiet like church on a Monday.

## US$90,000 A Month For American Lobby Firms

While the SOCU drama was playing out on Lombard Street, a quieter revelation emerged during budget estimates: the Government of Guyana is paying **two foreign lobbying firms a combined US$90,000 per month** to represent its interests abroad.

That is US$1.08 million per year. For lobbying.

Foreign Minister Hugh Todd confirmed this during questioning by FMG's Amanza Walton-Desir. The ministry has $269 million allocated for "advocacy services." One firm gets US$50,000 monthly. Another gets US$4,000.

WIN parliamentarian Tabitha Sarabo-Haley asked whether the lobby firms had any work related to extradition matters. Todd said no, the firms are hired to "highlight initiatives pertinent to national development."

A million dollars a year to tell America how nice we are. Meanwhile, the opposition leader telling parliament he funded the ruling party with hundreds of millions and nobody can find a receipt.

## 30 Students Caught Skipping School In City Sweep

Georgetown police rounded up thirty students caught outside school during school hours. No word on whether SOCU was involved or if they brought the dog.

## GuySuCo Says 2030 Turnaround Coming

The Guyana Sugar Corporation says it is on track for profitability by 2030. They have been on track for profitability since approximately 1966. The track appears to be circular.

## Berbice Bridge Acquisition

Government is finalising the process for full acquisition of the Berbice Bridge. Minister Edghill confirmed the details during budget estimates. After years of the private-public partnership model producing toll increases and public frustration, Georgetown wants full control. Whether government ownership means lower tolls or just different people collecting the same tolls remains to be seen.

## Chikungunya Cases Rising Across The Americas

Health authorities warn that chikungunya cases are increasing across the Caribbean and the Americas. As if we didn't have enough things to worry about between SOCU raids and lobby firm bills.

*The Guyana Daily Brief is satire. The SOCU raid, the lobby firm payments, the truant students, and the sugar corporation's optimism are all real. The commentary is ours.*
