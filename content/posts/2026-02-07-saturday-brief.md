Good morning, Guyana! ☕

Welcome to Saturday, where the Opposition Leader finally got his turn at the mic and DIDN'T hold back, a mystery extradition request has the government playing dumb, and Linden is celebrating a brand new stadium that the government hopes will make everyone forget about... well, everything else.

Grab your coffee. It's a LOT today.

## 1. 🎤 OPPOSITION LEADER MOHAMED RIPS BUDGET TO SHREDS

**Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News**

Newly-elected Leader of the Opposition Azruddin Mohamed delivered his maiden budget debate speech Friday night and came out SWINGING. His critique of the $1.558 TRILLION budget was basically a greatest hits album of everything wrong:

| Mohamed's Accusation | Government's Response |
|---|---|
| No salary increase for 70,000 public servants | *crickets* |
| Falling birth rate — women can't afford children | "But we gave cash grants!" |
| Chronic power outages STILL happening | "Gas-to-Energy coming... eventually" |
| Fishing industry in sharp decline | "Have you tried oil instead?" |
| Weak oversight of oil revenues | "Trust us" |

The man who the government has been calling "sanction man" and "international fugitive" stood up and said: "Despite the name calling... I stand as the youngest Leader of the Opposition because over 109,000 voters chose hope over fear."

**The Brief's Take:** Say what you want about Mohamed, but the man came prepared. Whether Parliament was listening is another story entirely.

## 2. 🕵️ SECRET US EXTRADITION REQUEST — GOVERNMENT PLAYING DUMB

**Sources: Kaieteur News, Stabroek News**

Plot twist in the Mohamed extradition saga! During cross-examination in court, Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Sharon Roopchand-Edwards casually revealed that the US sent ANOTHER extradition request on November 26, 2025. For a DIFFERENT person.

Who? Nobody knows. The government isn't talking.

| Person Asked | Response |
|---|---|
| Prime Minister Phillips | No comment |
| Home Affairs Minister Walrond | No comment |
| Attorney General Nandlall | No comment |

Mohamed himself demanded transparency during his budget speech: "Let the nation know about the extradition request... There is an extradition request since November and up to now, cannot charge and bring these persons."

**The Brief's Take:** Three senior government officials ALL refusing to comment about a US extradition request? Nothing suspicious about THAT at all. 🙄

## 3. 🏟️ BAYROC STADIUM OPENS TODAY IN LINDEN

**Sources: Guyana Chronicle, Kaieteur News**

After nearly a decade of waiting, Linden TODAY unveils the Bayroc National Stadium — complete with synthetic track, floodlights, professional facilities, and a Pre-Mashramani concert featuring Samuel Medas and Diana Chapman.

The opening ceremony at 6pm includes an athletics championship AND a Georgetown vs. Linden football match. The stadium is one of five regional stadiums under construction, all expected to open in 2026.

**The Brief's Take:** Credit where credit is due — Linden needed this. The question is whether the government will maintain it or let it become another monument to ribbon-cutting. Ask Leonora about their track.

## 4. ⛏️ ALI PROMISES SMALL MINERS THE WORLD (IF THEY DECLARE THEIR GOLD)

**Sources: All 4 Papers**

President Ali went deep into mining country — Puruni AND Bartica — on Friday with a message that was equal parts carrot and stick. The carrot: land, trucks, bank accounts, community policing groups, consortium support. The stick: declare your gold or get shut down.

| The Promise | The Catch |
|---|---|
| Government will identify land for consortiums | Must declare ALL gold |
| Banks coming directly to mining communities | Must have legal operations |
| Duty removed on ATVs, reduced on pickups | Must sell to Guyana Gold Board |
| Equipment and trucking support | Illegal foreign miners will be expelled |

Gold declarations target for 2026: 510,450 ounces. Last year: 484,321 ounces.

**The Brief's Take:** The promises sound great. But we've been hearing "formalise the mining sector" for years. The real question: will the government enforce the rules equally, or will certain "connected" miners continue to operate with impunity?

## 5. ⚡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: PHASE ONE STILL DRAGGING, PHASE TWO ALREADY BIDDING

**Sources: Kaieteur News**

In a move that perfectly captures the government's "don't look at the unfinished thing, look at the NEW shiny thing" strategy, PM Phillips revealed that five EPC contractors have been shortlisted for Gas-to-Energy Phase Two, with bids due March 31, 2026.

Meanwhile, Phase One is... still under construction. 67% of foundation piling done. Simple-cycle first power projected by "end of 2026."

**The Brief's Take:** Starting to recruit for Phase Two before Phase One is finished is either incredible forward planning or a masterclass in distraction. We're going with "why not both?"

## 6. ⚖️ ICJ BORDER CASE: ORAL HEARINGS START MAY 4

**Sources: Kaieteur News**

AG Nandlall announced during budget debates that the International Court of Justice will begin oral hearings on the Guyana-Venezuela border case on May 4, 2026. Both countries have filed two written pleadings each.

Guyana is seeking confirmation that the 1899 Arbitral Award is valid and binding. Venezuela... still claims two-thirds of the country.

**The Brief's Take:** This is genuinely one of the most important things happening in Guyana's history. Whatever your politics, every Guyanese should be paying attention to May 4th.

## 7. 🏏 T20 WORLD CUP: WINDIES VS SCOTLAND TODAY!

**Sources: Kaieteur News**

West Indies open their T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland TODAY at Eden Gardens, Kolkata! Captain Shai Hope said the team wants to make Caribbean fans proud and is "aiming to win games."

Coach Daren Sammy is riding the nostalgia of 2016 when the Windies won the title at the same venue. Match bowls off from 5:30am Guyana time.

**The Brief's Take:** Wake up early, Guyana! And if the Windies lose to Scotland, we are collectively going back to sleep and pretending this day never happened.

## 8. 🚨 POLICE CORPORAL STABBED IN MAHDIA BRAWL

**Sources: All 4 Papers**

A police corporal responding to a street brawl near Mahdia Primary School at 1:45am Friday was attacked by two men who tried to disarm him. One attacker had scissors. The corporal was stabbed in the abdomen and arm, then shot the armed attacker in response.

Both the corporal and the 22-year-old pork-knocker from Campbelltown are in stable condition at Mahdia District Hospital.

**The Brief's Take:** Police responding to a street brawl at 1:45am get attacked with scissors and pelted with objects. Interior life continues to be wild.

## 9. 💼 GUYSUCU REVERSES SALARY INCREASES — STAFF FURIOUS

**Sources: Stabroek News**

GuySuCo quietly reversed salary increases that Senior Staff had been receiving since September 2025. The increases were part of band adjustments when the minimum wage went to $100,000. Staff received official letters with new salaries. Then in January 2026... salaries reverted to August 2025 levels.

No explanation. No notice. No pay slips issued. People already made financial commitments based on the higher salary.

**The Brief's Take:** Giving someone a raise, letting them plan their finances around it for five months, then snatching it back without even telling them? That's not management. That's cruelty.

---

## 10. 🚁 HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT: STILL CLASSIFIED

**Sources: Stabroek News Editorial**

Stabroek News editorial goes IN on the government for refusing to release the Bell 402 helicopter crash investigation report. Minister Indar claims "military mission" as justification, which contradicts Minister Edghill's earlier promises to release it.

The editorial notes two issues are being conflated: the purpose of the mission vs. the airworthiness and safety findings.

**The Brief's Take:** If the helicopter had a mechanical failure, the public has a right to know — military mission or not. What exactly are they hiding?

## 📰 QUICK HITS

**Guyana Chronicle:** Saipem receives ExxonMobil's "Local Impact Award" for local content development. AGM Inc. introduces paid paternity leave.

**Kaieteur News:** Duncan files motion demanding full media access to Parliament. Opposition Chief Whip writes Speaker about alleged sexual harassment by Minister McKoy.

**Stabroek News:** Lethem residents still paying high electricity bills despite THREE renewable energy sources (solar farm + two hydro dams). The PM promised rates would drop. They didn't.

**Guyana Times:** GDF boosting capabilities with more aircraft and marine vessels. Court rejects Mohamed's excuses to adjourn extradition hearing.
