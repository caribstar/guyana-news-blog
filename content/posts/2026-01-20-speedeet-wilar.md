Near de back fence, sitting on a pile of old mattresses like a KING on a throne, was de biggest, fattest, meanest-looking tabby cat either boy had ever seen.

**Wilar:** *(gulping)* Speedeet... dat cat bigger than yuh HEAD.

**Speedeet:** *(eyes wide)* Dat nah cat. Dat is a TIGER.

**Wilar:** We should leave it alone.

**Wilar:** Speedeet...

**Speedeet:** Dis is de BOSS LEVEL, Wilar! We cyaan walk away! Wha we guh tell we children?! "We had de shot and we nah take it"?!

**Wilar:** WE TWELVE! WE NAH GOT CHILDREN!

**Speedeet:** FUTURE CHILDREN, BAI! NOW COVER ME!

Speedeet stand up from behind de bush, take aim at de massive tabby, and let loose.

*FWIP!*

De pebble arc through de air... AND HIT DE CAT RIGHT ON IT BELLY.

De cat open one eye.

Look at Speedeet.

And START RUNNING TOWARD HIM.

**Speedeet:** OH GOSH OH GOSH OH GOSH!

**Speedeet:** WHY IT CHASING WE?!

**Wilar:** BECAUSE YUH SHOOT IT!!!

**Speedeet:** IT WAS SUPPOSED TO RUN DE OTHER WAY!!!

**Wilar:** TELL DE CAT DAT!!!

They run past de maintenance building, past de garbage area, past a very confused nurse on she smoke break, through a door marked "STAFF ONLY," down a corridor, and FINALLY lose de cat when they duck into a supply closet.

**Wilar:** *(panting)* Me... heart... guh... EXPLODE...

They sit in de supply closet, laughing until dey belly hurt, surrounded by toilet paper and cleaning supplies.

## De Truth

Derek spend two more weeks in hospital before dem discharge him. De carpet labaria bite leave a permanent scar on he leg and a story he guh tell at every family gathering fuh de rest of he life.

Speedeet and Wilar never tell nobody bout de cat hunt. But every time dey see a tabby cat after dat, dey does walk a lil faster.

De fat tabby? Still ruling de Georgetown Hospital compound like a king. Some seh it got BIGGER.

Speedeet swear he guh go back one day fuh a rematch.

Wilar already planning he excuse fuh why he cyaan go.
