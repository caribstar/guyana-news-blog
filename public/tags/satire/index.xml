&lt;p>&lt;strong>What Happened:&lt;/strong> President Ali declared that future cash grants are &amp;ldquo;not sustainable,&amp;rdquo; warning that &amp;ldquo;some people would use this as a political opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Backstory:&lt;/strong> Just one year ago, the government was &amp;ldquo;committed to making future cash grants.&amp;rdquo; What a difference 365 days makes!&lt;/p>

&lt;li>2025: &amp;ldquo;We are committed to future cash grants!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2026: &amp;ldquo;Cash grants are not sustainable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Welcome to Tuesday, where census data finally arrives (only 4 years late!) and Parliament continues its record-breaking streak of doing absolutely nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today&amp;rsquo;s menu:&lt;/strong> Census numbers drop after a 4-year delay, oil wells still racing toward empty, Parliament enters Week 11 of ghosting us, and unauthorized supermarkets get shut down faster than you can say &amp;ldquo;planning permission.&amp;rdquo; Also, Guyana can&amp;rsquo;t say no to the US. Shocking, we know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monday's Guyana Brief: The Week Starts With a Yelling</title><link>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-12-monday-brief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-12-monday-brief/</guid><description>&lt;p>Good morning, Guyana! ☕&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Welcome to Monday, where last week&amp;rsquo;s problems are this week&amp;rsquo;s problems with a fresh coat of optimistic denial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing got fixed over the weekend. Shocked? You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today&amp;rsquo;s menu:&lt;/strong> GuySuCo gets scolded (again), The Mohameds perfect the art of not leaving, crime stats achieve Olympic-level creativity, and we learn why complaining about bribery is somehow worse than actual bribery. Just another week in paradise!&lt;/p>
