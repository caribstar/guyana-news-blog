STORAGE UNIT?!\nThis youngin’ really called Guyana “America’s Storage Unit” and think he CLEVER?\nLet Uncle Ramesh break down why The Brief got it HALF right and HALF wrong (as usual).\nGE UNIT\" - CUTE HEADLINE, WRONG TAKE The Brief says: “Guyana volunteers as America’s storage unit”\nUncle Ramesh says: Where was this outrage when CORENTYNE been doing this for YEARS?!\nListen nah, this ain’t NEW! Guyana been accepting third-country nationals for DECADES! Brazilian miners! Venezuelan refugees! Where The Brief was THEN?\nThe REAL Story: Trump want to formalize what already happening! That’s it! That’s the story!\nBut The Brief Acting Like:\nThis is brand new (IT AIN’T!) Ali volunteered (HE NEGOTIATING!) Opposition suddenly care (THEY DON’T!) POSITION’S FAKE OUTRAGE The Brief says: “WIN and Forward Guyana are furious”\nUncle Ramesh says: WHERE THEY WAS BEFORE?!\nThese same opposition parties been SILENT about:\nVenezuelan migrants (thousands!) Brazilian miners (hundreds!) Backroom deals during THEIR time in power! But NOW they care? Because Trump involved? PLEASE!\nThe Real Reason They Mad: Not the deportations. They mad because THEY not the ones making the deal!\nIf THEY was in government doing this, The Brief and opposition would be DEFENDING it!\nNEZUELA DRAMA: THE BRIEF FINALLY CATCHING UP The Brief says: “Ali supports regional security efforts”\nUncle Ramesh says: EXACTLY! And that’s the RIGHT move!\nThis youngin’ acting like Ali got a CHOICE! You think Guyana can tell America “no”?\nThe Options:\nSupport America = Keep military protection against Venezuela Oppose America = Lose protection, Venezuela invades next week Which one YOU picking, Brief?\nBut no, The Brief wanna make jokes instead of understanding GEOPOLITICS!\nâš–ï¸ THE MOHAMEDS: WE AGREE AGAIN (SHOCKING!) Okay, fine. The Brief got THIS right. The Mohameds turning appeals into a CAREER.\nUncle Ramesh’s Addition: But WHERE the investigation into the JUDGES? Why these cases taking SO LONG? Why the system ALLOWING infinite appeals?\nFix the SYSTEM, not just complain about the Mohameds using it!\nTREET BRIDGE: THE BRIEF MISSING THE POINT (AGAIN) The Brief says: “Bridge cracked and sinking”\nUncle Ramesh says: It OLD! What you expect?!\nListen, bridges DON’T last forever! High Street Bridge been there for DECADES! OF COURSE it needs work!\nThe REAL Question: Why it take THIS LONG to identify? Where was the regular inspections?\nBut The Brief Just: “Ha ha, another infrastructure failure!”\nNo analysis. No context. Just jokes.\nOOLS: THE BRIEF BEING CYNICAL FOR NO REASON The Brief says: “Election year special!”\nUncle Ramesh says: SO WHAT?!\nSchools being built! Kids getting education! WHO CARES if it’s election year?!\nHere in Queens: Politicians do stuff before elections ALL THE TIME! That’s how democracy WORKS! You do things, people vote for you!\nThe Brief’s Logic: If government does something BEFORE election = cynical politics If government does something AFTER election = broken promises\nSo when they SUPPOSED to do it?! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!\nNSPIRACY: FINALLY THE BRIEF GETS SERIOUS The Brief says: “Tax collectors helping people avoid taxes”\nUncle Ramesh says: THIS the story! Focus on THIS!\nThis is ACTUAL corruption! This is REAL scandal! Not “storage unit” jokes!\nWhy This Matters:\nMillions in lost revenue Internal corruption Nobody going to jail (yet) System broken But The Brief: Spent more words on “storage unit” headline than THIS actual scandal!\nPRIORITIES, youngin’! PRIORITIES!\nR DRAMA: THE BRIEF WRONG ON BOTH Incident #1 - French Vlogger:\nThe Brief sides with the vlogger. Uncle Ramesh says: CONTEXT MATTERS!\nYou can’t just put camera in people FACE in the market! Vendor maybe overreacted, but the vlogger was RUDE first!\nIn Queens: You point camera at people in market without asking? You MIGHT get slapped too! That’s universal!\nIncident #2 - British Vlogger:\nThe Brief says Chronicle overreacted. Uncle Ramesh says: CHRONICLE WAS RIGHT!\nThis British boy come to Guyana, film ONLY the bad parts, ignore EVERYTHING good, then call us “Third World”?\nWhat He Ignored:\nNew highways Modern buildings Hotels Development What He Filmed:\nGarbage dumps Old buildings Poor areas That’s not journalism! That’s HIT PIECE!\nHE BRIEF REALLY MISSED Let Uncle Ramesh tell you what The Brief IGNORED:\nThe Deportation Deal Details: What countries they from? How many people? What support they getting? Long-term plan? The Brief: “Storage unit lol”\nUncle Ramesh: “Give us DETAILS!”\nThe Regional Context: Trinidad doing same thing Brazil too Panama too This is REGIONAL issue, not just Guyana!\nThe Opposition’s Hypocrisy: Where they was when Coalition government made backroom deals? SILENT!\nRAMESH’S COUNTER-BRIEF What We ACTUALLY Learned Friday:\nâš ï¸ Third-country nationals thing NOT new (Brief missed this) âœ… Opposition being hypocritical (we agree!) âš ï¸ Mohameds still appealing (system broken, not just them) âš ï¸ High Street Bridge OLD, not new failure (context!) âš ï¸ 18 schools good news, stop being cynical! âœ… GRA corruption serious (finally!) âš ï¸ Vloggers got mixed response (not black/white!) WORD FROM QUEENS This youngin’ write clever headlines but miss the SUBSTANCE!\n“Storage Unit”? Cute. But where the ANALYSIS? Where the CONTEXT?\nMessages for The Brief:\nOn Deportations: Do your RESEARCH! This ain’t new! Ask about DETAILS, not just make jokes!\nOn Opposition: Call out the HYPOCRISY! Where they was before?!\nOn Mohameds: You right! But ask about the SYSTEM too!\nOn Bridge: It OLD! That’s different from Heroes Highway! Learn the difference!\nOn Schools: Take the WIN! Schools being built! Kids benefiting! Stop being negative!\nOn GRA: THIS the scandal! Focus MORE on this!\nOn Vloggers: CONTEXT matters! Both sides got points!\nMy wife reminding me we got grocery shopping to do. At least I won’t get slapped filming in Stop \u0026 Shop!\nStay INFORMED. Stay BALANCED. Stop with the clever headlines and DO THE WORK!\nâ€” Uncle Ramesh\nCalling from Queens, NY\nWhere we understand that “storage unit” jokes ain’t analysis\nâ±ï¸ Uncle Ramesh Talk Time: 5 minutes\nâ˜• Coffee consumed: 2 cups (spilled some laughing at “storage unit”)\ns I disagreed with The Brief:** 6 out of 8 stories\nrolls:** 12\nStill proud:** Always (even with deportees)\ncle Ramesh keeps The Brief honest since 2026!\nShare this if you think headlines need substance too!\n",

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;WIN and Forward Guyana are furious&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> WHERE THEY WAS BEFORE?!</p>
<p>These same opposition parties been SILENT about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venezuelan migrants (thousands!)</li>
<li>Brazilian miners (hundreds!)</li>
<li>Backroom deals during THEIR time in power!</li>
</ul>
<p>But NOW they care? Because Trump involved? <strong>PLEASE!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Real Reason They Mad:</strong>
Not the deportations. They mad because THEY not the ones making the deal!</p>
<p>If THEY was in government doing this, The Brief and opposition would be DEFENDING it!</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Ali supports regional security efforts&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> EXACTLY! And that&rsquo;s the RIGHT move!</p>
<p>This youngin&rsquo; acting like Ali got a CHOICE! You think Guyana can tell America &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</p>
<p><strong>The Options:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Support America = Keep military protection against Venezuela</li>
<li>Oppose America = Lose protection, Venezuela invades next week</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Which one YOU picking, Brief?</strong></p>
<p>But no, The Brief wanna make jokes instead of understanding GEOPOLITICS!</p>

<p>Okay, fine. The Brief got THIS right. The Mohameds turning appeals into a CAREER.</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh&rsquo;s Addition:</strong>
But WHERE the investigation into the JUDGES? Why these cases taking SO LONG? Why the system ALLOWING infinite appeals?</p>
<p>Fix the SYSTEM, not just complain about the Mohameds using it!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="treet-bridge-the-brief-missing-the-point-again">TREET BRIDGE: THE BRIEF MISSING THE POINT (AGAIN)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#treet-bridge-the-brief-missing-the-point-again">#</a></h2>
<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Bridge cracked and sinking&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> It OLD! What you expect?!</p>
<p>Listen, bridges DON&rsquo;T last forever! High Street Bridge been there for DECADES! OF COURSE it needs work!</p>
<p><strong>The REAL Question:</strong>
Why it take THIS LONG to identify? Where was the regular inspections?</p>
<p><strong>But The Brief Just:</strong>
&ldquo;Ha ha, another infrastructure failure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No analysis. No context. Just jokes.</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Election year special!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> SO WHAT?!</p>
<p>Schools being built! Kids getting education! WHO CARES if it&rsquo;s election year?!</p>
<p><strong>Here in Queens:</strong>
Politicians do stuff before elections ALL THE TIME! That&rsquo;s how democracy WORKS! You do things, people vote for you!</p>
<p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Logic:</strong>
If government does something BEFORE election = cynical politics
If government does something AFTER election = broken promises</p>
<p>So when they SUPPOSED to do it?! <strong>MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!</strong></p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Tax collectors helping people avoid taxes&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> THIS the story! Focus on THIS!</p>
<p>This is ACTUAL corruption! This is REAL scandal! Not &ldquo;storage unit&rdquo; jokes!</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Millions in lost revenue</li>
<li>Internal corruption</li>
<li>Nobody going to jail (yet)</li>
<li>System broken</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But The Brief:</strong>
Spent more words on &ldquo;storage unit&rdquo; headline than THIS actual scandal!</p>
<p>PRIORITIES, youngin&rsquo;! PRIORITIES!</p>

<h2 id="r-drama-the-brief-wrong-on-both">R DRAMA: THE BRIEF WRONG ON BOTH<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#r-drama-the-brief-wrong-on-both">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Incident #1 - French Vlogger:</strong></p>
<p>The Brief sides with the vlogger. Uncle Ramesh says: <strong>CONTEXT MATTERS!</strong></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just put camera in people FACE in the market! Vendor maybe overreacted, but the vlogger was RUDE first!</p>
<p><strong>In Queens:</strong>
You point camera at people in market without asking? You MIGHT get slapped too! That&rsquo;s universal!</p>
<p><strong>Incident #2 - British Vlogger:</strong></p>
<p>The Brief says Chronicle overreacted. Uncle Ramesh says: <strong>CHRONICLE WAS RIGHT!</strong></p>
<p>This British boy come to Guyana, film ONLY the bad parts, ignore EVERYTHING good, then call us &ldquo;Third World&rdquo;?</p>
<p><strong>What He Ignored:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New highways</li>
<li>Modern buildings</li>
<li>Hotels</li>
<li>Development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What He Filmed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Garbage dumps</li>
<li>Old buildings</li>
<li>Poor areas</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s not journalism! That&rsquo;s HIT PIECE!</p>
