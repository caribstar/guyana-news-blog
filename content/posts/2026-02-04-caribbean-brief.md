## 🗳️ BARBADOS: 7 DAYS TO ELECTION DAY

**Election Day: Tuesday, February 11, 2026**

The countdown is ON. Ninety-three candidates across four main parties are contesting 30 seats in what could be the most competitive Barbados election in years.

| Party | Candidates | Leader | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Barbados Labour Party (BLP)** | 30 | PM Mia Mottley | Going for third straight term. Won 30-0 in both 2018 and 2022 |
| **Democratic Labour Party (DLP)** | 30 | Ralph Thorne | Trying to claw back from two consecutive shutouts |
| **Friends of Democracy (FOD)** | 11-12 | New party | Pledging tax relief for seniors, penalties for late government payments |
| **People's Coalition for Progress (PCP)** | 15 | Alliance (NNP+UPP+CBLP) | First coalition attempt by smaller parties |
| **Reform Barbados** | TBD | New | Making debut |

**On the ground:** Barbados Today reports voters in St. Philip say most candidates are "invisible" despite the crowded ballot. One 76-year-old voter said no politician has ever done anything for her — "not even a biscuit."

Pollster Peter Wickham explains St. Philip has become a battleground because it's traditionally DLP country, and other parties see opportunities there. But he doubts third parties will make real inroads.

**The big question:** Can ANYONE break Mottley's grip? Two consecutive 30-0 sweeps is unprecedented. Even if the DLP wins a handful of seats, it would count as progress.

Final voter register drops February 7. Four days later, Barbados decides.

## 🏏 T20 WORLD CUP: WEST INDIES READY (THEY SAY)

The ICC Men's T20 World Cup starts **Friday, February 7** in India and Sri Lanka. West Indies are in Group C with England, Scotland, Nepal, and debutants Italy.

**West Indies Schedule:**

| Date | Opponent | Venue |
|------|----------|-------|
| Feb 7 | Scotland | Kolkata |
| Feb 11 | England | Mumbai |
| Feb 15 | Nepal | Mumbai |
| Feb 19 | Italy | Kolkata |

**The Squad:** Captain Shai Hope leads a team built on power hitting. Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, and Brandon King bring the muscle. Jason Holder provides experience and death bowling. Gudakesh Motie returns after fixing his bowling action — his left-arm spin could be crucial on subcontinental pitches.

Head Coach Daren Sammy, who captained the 2012 and 2016 title-winning teams, says the squad has "balance, extensive experience, and a touch of mystery." He believes "something special is about to happen."

**The concern:** West Indies have won only 14 of 43 T20Is since the 2024 World Cup — a 0.52 win-loss ratio. They lost recent series to Afghanistan (2-1), New Zealand (3-1), and South Africa (2-1). But Sammy sees parallels with his 2016 champions.

**Big tournament note:** Pakistan are boycotting their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo. They're still playing in the tournament but will forfeit that fixture.

## 🇺🇸 US MILITARY IN THE CARIBBEAN: STILL DIVIDING THE REGION

Operation Southern Spear continues, and Caribbean nations remain split on how to respond.

**Barbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds** has expressed concern that US strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels "may have bypassed due process" and risk setting a dangerous precedent.

**Trinidad PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar** says "no international law was breached" by T&T's cooperation with the US on regional anti-drug operations.

**US Senator Jack Reed** (Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee) has condemned the strikes, aligning with Caribbean voices questioning the legal basis.

**Amnesty International** warns that any airstrikes authorised by Congress would violate international human rights law and could amount to unlawful executions.

The Caribbean remains caught between its largest trading partner's military ambitions and its own sovereignty concerns. CARICOM has yet to issue a unified position — which tells you everything about how divided the region is on this.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: IMF MONEY AND POST-HURRICANE REALITY

Jamaica's international reserves remain "historically strong" despite the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which battered the island. The IMF approved US$415 million in emergency financial assistance to meet urgent balance-of-payments needs.

Meanwhile, West Indies Petroleum Terminal Limited (WIPT) has successfully listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange — a sign that despite natural disasters, the business sector keeps moving.

Jamaica PM Andrew Holness, fresh off winning his third consecutive term (a JLP first), is urging Jamaicans to "focus on building a future at home" amid US moves to pause certain migration pathways.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: POLICE SHOOTING SCANDAL CONTINUES

The fallout from a police shooting of an unarmed civilian continues in Trinidad and Tobago. CCTV footage showed officers firing on a man with his hands up, triggering widespread outrage.

Teachers staged mass sick calls disrupting classes across T&T in an apparently coordinated protest over working conditions. The education system is straining.

On the diplomatic front, the Trump administration has "reaffirmed the strength of its partnership" with PM Persad-Bissessar's government — positioning Trinidad as a US ally in the region while tensions with Venezuela simmer.

## ⚖️ CCJ PRESIDENT VISITS BARBADOS

Justice Winston Anderson, President of the Caribbean Court of Justice, and Registrar Gabrielle Figaro-Jones are paying an official visit to Barbados. The timing — one week before elections — is coincidental but notable. The CCJ remains an important institution for Caribbean legal sovereignty, particularly as the region navigates complex security and trade challenges.

## 💭 CARIBBEAN THOUGHT

Ninety-three candidates fighting for 30 seats in Barbados. A cricket World Cup starting in India. A US military operation nobody in the region asked for. And Jamaica rebuilding after yet another hurricane.

The Caribbean doesn't get quiet seasons. It just gets different kinds of busy.

One region. One family. Seven days until Barbados decides. 🌴
