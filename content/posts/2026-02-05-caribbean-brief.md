## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: ELECTION DAY IS WEDNESDAY

**The Countdown:**

Barbados heads to the polls on **February 11, 2026** — just six days away.

**The Players:**
- **BLP (Mia Mottley)** — Going for the three-peat after 30-0 sweeps in 2018 and 2022
- **DLP (Ralph Thorne)** — Hoping to win... one seat? Maybe?

**The Drama:**

PM Mottley has been slashing Ralph Thorne over an interview he gave to Trinidad media. Early voting is already underway. Schools will be closed on election day.

**The Reality:**

Political analyst Peter Wickham summed it up: "The conversation we are having these days is whether the opposition can actually gain a seat or two."

That's the bar. Not winning. Not being competitive. Just... existing in Parliament.

**Prediction:** Mottley wins big. Again.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $415 MILLION IMF EMERGENCY CASH

**The Bailout:**

The IMF Executive Board has approved Jamaica's request for **emergency financial assistance of approximately US$415 million**.

**Why:**

Jamaica is facing urgent balance-of-payments needs. The details are still emerging, but this is significant emergency support from the Fund.

**The Context:**

Jamaica has been on an economic reform trajectory for years, but external shocks continue to test resilience. This injection provides breathing room.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: PM KAMLA DOUBLES DOWN ON CARICOM CRITICISM

**The Rift:**

Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar used Parliament on Friday to call for **major transformation within CARICOM**.

**Her Position:**

The PM has been vocal about the regional body's effectiveness (or lack thereof), questioning whether CARICOM is actually delivering for member states.

**The Pattern:**

This isn't new. Trinidad has often been the loudest voice questioning regional integration while simultaneously benefiting from it.

**CARICOM Response:**

The regional body is focused on other fires — namely Haiti.

## 🇭🇹 CARICOM REBUKES HAITI LEADERSHIP

**The Crisis:**

In a rare and sharply worded rebuke, Caribbean leaders have placed Haiti's transitional leadership under **renewed regional scrutiny**.

**The Target:**

Efforts are underway to remove caretaker Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils Aimé amid deepening instability.

**The Numbers:**
- 1.4 million internally displaced
- Gang violence escalating
- Elections postponed to August/December 2026
- Transitional Presidential Council mandate expires February 7th

**The Reality:**

Haiti remains in freefall, and the region is running out of patience with transitional arrangements that produce no transitions.

## 🛂 US VISA CRACKDOWN HITS CARIBBEAN

**The Squeeze:**

The United States is tightening visa scrutiny across the Caribbean as part of a crackdown on **birth tourism** and **citizenship-by-investment** concerns.

**Countries Affected:**
- Barbados
- Trinidad and Tobago
- Jamaica
- Antigua and Barbuda (partial travel restrictions)
- Dominica
- Grenada

**What's Happening:**
- More rigorous visa interviews
- Questions about travel intent
- Pregnant applicants face extra scrutiny
- Processing delays expected

**For Antigua & Barbuda:**

Beginning January 2026, partial travel restrictions tied to security vetting and CBI programme concerns are in effect.

**The Message:**

Using a tourist visa for maternity care in the US will likely result in denial. Washington is watching.

## ✈️ CARIBBEAN TOURISM TAKES A HIT

**The Decline:**

After 12 consecutive months of growth, several Caribbean destinations saw **significant declines in U.S. tourist arrivals** in 2025:

- Bermuda
- Aruba

**The Causes:**
- Economic pressures and inflation
- Rising cost of international travel

## 🏆 BAJAN STUDENTS WIN REGIONAL AI STOCK GAME

- 128,960 trades on the Jamaica Stock Exchange
- 27,379 trades on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange

**The Significance:**

Education Minister noted this reflects Barbados's broader reform agenda to equip students with 21st-century skills.

**One Winner's Strategy:**

"I really focused on the Jamaican markets... basically buying and selling Trinidad and Jamaican stocks daily."

**Translation:** Bajan kids beat Trini kids at their own stock market game. That's cold.
