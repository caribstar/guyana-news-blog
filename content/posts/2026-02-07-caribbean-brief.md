## 🌴 CARIBBEAN BRIEF — Saturday, February 7, 2026

Good morning, Caribbean! The region is BUZZING today — Carnival starting in Trinidad, an election heating up in Barbados, cricket in Kolkata, and Jamaica still trying to figure out how to pay its bills. Let's dive in!

## 1. 🎭 TRINIDAD CARNIVAL 2026: IT'S HERE!

**Carnival Season officially runs February 7-10** and Port of Spain is about to be UNRECOGNISABLE. Steelpan competitions, masquerade bands, J'ouvert, and enough soca music to vibrate the entire Lesser Antilles.

This year's Carnival comes as T&T's PM is set to address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid a multi-billion dollar energy investment surge. So Trinidad partying AND doing business — the T&T way.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** If you're in Port of Spain and NOT in a costume, what are you even doing there?

## 2. 🗳️ BARBADOS ELECTION: 4 DAYS AND COUNTING

**Election Day: Wednesday, February 11.** Schools will be closed to serve as polling stations. Early voting is ALREADY underway.

PM Mia Mottley's BLP is defending its clean sweep from 2022. She recently slammed opposition figure Ralph Thorne's interview with T&T media, calling it misleading.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Barbados elections are usually calmer than the rest of the Caribbean. Usually. With early voting already underway, this one feels different.

## 3. 💰 JAMAICA TAKES $415M IMF EMERGENCY LOAN

The IMF executive board approved Jamaica's request for approximately **US$415 million** in emergency financial assistance to help meet urgent balance-of-payments needs.

Jamaica, the Caribbean's largest English-speaking economy, continues to struggle with debt, despite years of austerity and reform. This latest emergency funding is a lifeline — but also a reminder that the island's fiscal challenges are far from over.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Jamaica has been on the IMF treadmill for decades. At this point, the IMF has a permanent desk in Kingston.

## 4. 🏏 T20 WORLD CUP: WINDIES VS SCOTLAND — TODAY!

West Indies open their 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland at Eden Gardens, Kolkata! Match starts at 5:30am Caribbean time (set those alarms!).

Captain Shai Hope is confident: "We will be representing our people back home." Coach Daren Sammy returns to Kolkata where the Windies won the title in 2016.

**Key Windies Concern:** Shimron Hetmyer is reportedly STRANDED and may miss early matches due to logistical setbacks. Because of COURSE something had to go wrong.

The 10th edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup is being hosted across India and Sri Lanka.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** The whole Caribbean will be up at 5:30am watching. If Hetmyer is really stranded somewhere, we need a GoFundMe for his plane ticket IMMEDIATELY.

## 5. 🛂 US TIGHTENS VISA SCREWS ON CARIBBEAN NATIONALS

Multiple Caribbean nations — including Barbados, Trinidad & Tobago, Jamaica, Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, and Grenada — are facing **stricter US visa scrutiny** in 2026 as Washington cracks down on birth tourism.

New measures include enhanced interviews, deeper examination of travel intent, and questions about medical plans for pregnant travelers. Antigua & Barbuda faces partial travel restrictions linked to its citizenship-by-investment programme.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Caribbean people who've been visiting the US for decades now getting interrogated like they're applying for Top Secret clearance. Thanks, 2026.

## 6. 🇭🇹 HAITI: TPS RULING REFLECTS "DEEPENING CRISIS"

Doctors Without Borders has highlighted a US judicial ruling on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) that reflects Haiti's continuing humanitarian catastrophe. The ruling acknowledges that conditions in Haiti remain too dangerous for deportees.

Meanwhile, the security situation in Port-au-Prince continues to deteriorate, with armed gangs controlling large portions of the capital.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Haiti remains the Caribbean's most urgent crisis and the world continues to offer thoughts, prayers, and not much else.

---

## 7. ⚖️ JAMAICA INTEGRITY COMMISSION GOES AFTER 10 OFFICIALS

Ten Jamaican public servants are facing scrutiny for failing to submit mandatory statutory declarations. Eight are set to be charged, with two cases referred to the DPP. Three former employees of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Commission are among those targeted.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Jamaica's Integrity Commission actually doing its job! Somebody in Guyana should take notes on how accountability works.

## 8. 🇹🇼 TAIWAN DONATES $3M TO ST. VINCENT

Taiwan has donated US$3 million to aid St. Vincent's social relief programs, continuing its diplomatic engagement with Caribbean nations that recognise Taipei.

**The Caribbean Brief Says:** Taiwan and China continuing their cheque-book diplomacy across the Caribbean. Small island states playing both sides like pros.

## 🗺️ REGIONAL QUICK HITS

**CCJ News:** Justice Winston Anderson and Registrar Gabrielle Figaro-Jones are making official visits across the region — strengthening Caribbean judicial cooperation.

**Dominican Republic:** Opening a "tourism war" with Mexico, aggressively marketing its beaches and nightlife to steal market share.
