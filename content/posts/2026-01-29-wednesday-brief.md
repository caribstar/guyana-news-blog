## 💰 GRA Officers Getting Lock Up Over Azruddin Mohamed's Fancy Cars

Well, well, well... remember how everybody was wondering how certain vehicles was getting through customs smoother than a greased-up mango seed? The Guyana Revenue Authority done fire several officers and now they heading to court for AML/CFT violations connected to transferring vehicles from our favourite US-sanctioned businessman, Azruddin Mohamed. 

The same man who can't get into America but somehow his paperwork flowing through GRA like butter. Somebody wasn't just looking the other way – they was actively helping! Now watch how everybody suddenly "didn't know nothing" and "was just following orders." 

*De Brief asks: How many other luxury vehicles got the VIP treatment at customs?*

## 🏛️ APNU Walk Out of Opposition Leader Election – Mark "Absent"

Monday's attempt to elect a Leader of the Opposition turned into a circus when all 12 APNU MPs walked out of the meeting called by Speaker Manzoor Nadir. The Clerk of the National Assembly Sherlock Isaacs (yes, Sherlock – you can't make this up) marked them as "absent."

So we still don't have an Opposition Leader months after the election. Democracy looking real healthy, eh? Between the government saying "not our business" and the Opposition playing musical chairs with themselves, the people of Guyana watching this soap opera and wondering who writing the script.

*De Brief asks: At this rate, will we have an Opposition Leader before Mashramani or before the next election?*

## 📊 Budget 2026 Debate Continues – $1.558 TRILLION Strong

The National Assembly continuing to debate the monster $1.558 trillion Budget 2026 this week. That's a 307% increase since 2021! Some highlights:

- **$183.6 billion** for education
- **$161.1 billion** for health  
- **$159.1 billion** for housing (15,000 new house lots, 8,000 homes)

- Income tax threshold up to $140,000
- Because We Care grant now $60,000

Critics saying the rich getting richer while the poor getting "sores." Supporters saying this is people-centred development. Either way, that's a whole lot of zeros being thrown around. Just make sure they reach the right hands this time, eh?

*De Brief asks: When dem cash grants coming though? Asking for a friend... and everybody else.*

## 🚗 8,000 Speed Governors Coming to Slow Down Truckers

The government buying 8,000 speed governors (limiters) to put on trucks this year. If you ever been on the road and had a truck trying to climb into your back seat, you know this is long overdue.

Minister Singh announced this as part of road safety measures. Now truckers won't be able to treat the highway like a race track. Though knowing Guyana, somebody already figuring out how to bypass them...

*De Brief asks: Can we put speed limiters on minibus drivers too? Asking for every pedestrian.*

## 🏭 RUSAL Coming Back to Berbice!

In a surprise announcement, the Russian aluminum company RUSAL has agreed to return to Guyana after shutting down operations six years ago during that infamous industrial dispute. The government confirmed the deal just days ago.

The Upper Berbice operations could mean jobs returning to an area that took a serious hit when the company pulled out. Let's hope this time the relationship runs smoother than the last round.

*De Brief asks: Will the workers get a better deal this time around?*
