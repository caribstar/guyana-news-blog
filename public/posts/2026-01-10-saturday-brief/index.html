Think Les Misérables, but the convict owns bulletproof cars.\nWhat The Papers Said:\nKAIETEUR: Gave him the entire front page. \"THIS IS NOT LAW, THIS IS OPPRESSION!\" (Also Kaieteur: sold more papers that day)\nCHRONICLE: \"Prosecution wants earlier date\" (translation: Florida is TIRED)\nSTABROEK: Mysteriously silent (lawyers probably said \"don't touch this\")\nGUYANA TIMES: \"Case adjourned to February 5\" (just the facts, ma'am)\nThe Plot Twist: While Mohamed writes 2,000 words about persecution, the prosecution is literally begging: “Can we PLEASE do this sooner?” and the defense lawyers are like “Sorry, we’re washing our hair until February.”\nMohamed’s Grievances Include:\nInsurance companies won’t cover his bulletproof vehicles anymore (the AUDACITY) GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping him commit fraud, but details!) His lands are being “illegally occupied” (by people who probably have actual legal papers) The government is using “political influence” (from the guy indicted for using business influence) The Persecution-O-Meter:\n98% Victim / 2% Consequences\rActual Persecution: Being asked to answer fraud charges\nMohamed's Persecution: Everything including gravity\nNext Court Date: February 5 (unless they file to delay the delay)\n⚡ STORY #2: CONTRACTOR DISCOVERS ELECTRICITY THE HARD WAY Breaking: RZND Concrete Company decided to play “How Close Can We Get to 69,000 Volts Before Someone Arrests Us?”\nSpoiler Alert: Not very close!\nThe Setup:\nGPL has a 69,000-volt transmission line This line connects Sophia to Good Hope (keeps Regions 4 \u0026 5 from becoming candlelit dinner zones) Contractor extends concrete pump DIRECTLY OVER IT GPL: “ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!” GPL’s Strongly Worded Letter:\n╔════════════════════════════════════════╗\r║ ⚠️ NATIONAL EMERGENCY ALERT ⚠️ ║\r║ ║\r║ CONTRACTOR: Actively courting death ║\r║ VOLTAGE: 69,000 (crispy level) ║\r║ REGIONS AFFECTED: Everyone ║\r║ STATUS: Contractor detained ║\r║ ║\r║ \"One miscalculation could have ║\r║ triggered MAJOR SYSTEM FAILURE\" ║\r║ ║\r║ TRANSLATION: Y'all almost blacked ║\r║ out the entire coast because someone ║\r║ can't see giant power lines ║\r╚════════════════════════════════════════╝\rBest Part: This is the SECOND time in THREE MONTHS! Last time, someone tried to move a police station and hit power lines.\nNew Guyana Construction Checklist:\nGet construction permit Check for underground utilities Check for OVERHEAD UTILITIES (we keep forgetting this one!) Maybe ask “will this plunge 100,000 people into darkness?” Call GPL at 226-2600 (this number is in the press release for a reason!) 📈 STORY #3: 2025 STATISTICS - A HORROR STORY Murders: ⬆️ UP 11% (130 people dead)\nRoad Deaths: ⬆️ UP 6% (137 people dead)\nTotal Accidents: ⬇️ DOWN 10%\nWait… WHAT?\nGPF: \"Great news! Accidents are DOWN!\"\nAlso GPF: \"Bad news! Deaths are UP!\"\nUs: \"How does that even—\"\nGPF: \"We're as confused as you are.\"\nWorld Bank: \"Your 15 deaths per 100,000 is UNACCEPTABLY HIGH\"\nGovernment: \"We'll get it to 50 total by 2030!\"\nCurrent Trajectory: Going from 137 to 50... by adding more each year? Bold strategy!\nTranslation: We’re having FEWER crashes, but when we crash, we’re doing it PROFESSIONALLY. Quality over quantity, apparently.\nGovernment’s Road Safety Plan:\nInstall cameras ✓ Issue e-tickets ✓ Hope really hard ✓ Actually fix roads ❌ Driver education ❌ 🎬 STORY #4: GUYANA TOURISM PRESENTS: “DON’T FILM THIS” Act 1: The British Vlogger\nEllis Riding arrives in Georgetown with a camera. Films garbage dumps, street people, and dangerous areas. Says Guyana is “one of the most Third World places” he’s seen.\nChronicle’s Response: Publishes 1,000-word column calling him a “10th-rate British foot-traveller” with “rotten mentality” who’s “probably paid by the opposition.”\nChronicle’s Defense: “It’s dangerous in Miami too!” (This is the new national slogan apparently)\nAct 2: The French Vlogger\nAntony D’Oliveira is filming. Vendor Quacy McKay doesn’t want to be filmed. Logical response? SLAP HIM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.\nMcKay’s Court Explanation: “I was just trying to move the camera!”\nJudge: “Sir, that’s not how cameras work.”\nBail: ,000\nTourism Guyana’s New Slogan Ideas:\n🎥 UPDATED TOURISM WARNINGS\rFilm something nice: You're a hero! Come back soon!\nFilm reality: Chronicle will question your ancestry\nFilm a vendor: That's a slappin'\nComplain: \"But Miami though!\"\nGuyana: Come for the oil, leave with assault charges!\n🏗️ STORY #5: VP ANNOUNCES INFINITY HOUSES The Grand Plan: Build 40,000 houses in 5 years!\nThe Math They Should’ve Done:\n40,000 houses ÷ 5 years = 8,000/year\n8,000 ÷ 365 days = 22 HOUSES PER DAY\n22 houses ÷ 24 hours = ONE HOUSE EVERY 65 MINUTES\nAROUND THE CLOCK. NO BREAKS. NO WEEKENDS. FOR FIVE YEARS.\nOne Letter Writer’s Take:\n\"This is ludicrous and comical... tantamount to putting 10 pounds grocery in a 5-pound bag\"\nProblems He Identified:\nNo zoning laws (houses wherever!)\rNo building codes (walls optional!)\rNo inspections (safety is a social construct!)\rThe dreaded 4 S's: Sliding, Slipping, Sagging, Sinking\rLand titles take forever and cost a fortune\rPoor roads, garbage everywhere, water scarce\rHis Verdict: \"Another colossal failure in the making\"\nPrevious Government “Trust Me Bro” Projects:\n❌ Amaila Falls Hydropower (fell through) ❌ Surendra Hospital (still not sure what happened) ❌ Skeldon Sugar Factory (sweet disaster) 🎲 40,000 Houses (place your bets now!) 💡 STORY #6: THE ELECTRICITY PROMISE ENTERS THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM October 2024: “I promise to cut electricity by 50% before end of 2025!” - President Ali\nJanuary 2026: crickets\nCurrent Situation:\nMonth 1 Bill: ,000\nMonth 2 Bill (same usage): ,000\nGPL Explanation: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nCitizens: \"Can you explain the difference?\"\nGPL: *currently dealing with contractors trying to blow up transmission lines*\nPresident's Promise: Last seen heading to the airport with a fake mustache\nMay 2025 Quote: “Infrastructure transformation beyond anyone’s wildest imagination!”\nJanuary 2026 Reality: Bills still wildly unpredictable, Heroes Highway needs repairs after 2 years, and we almost lost power because someone extended a concrete pump.\nWildest Imagination Status: Confirmed.\n🤫 STORY #7: HAS ANYONE SEEN THE OPPOSITION? Last Spotted: Norton gave a press conference about deportees\nCurrent Status: MISSING\nKaieteur’s Editorial: “Calling the opposition, calling the opposition”\n🚨 MISSING PERSON ALERT 🚨\nNAME: The Opposition\nLAST SEEN: Making a statement about something\nDESCRIPTION: Should be loud and oppositional\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR: Suspiciously quiet\nIF FOUND: Please remind them about:\nElectricity bills still high\r22 houses per day is impossible\rMurders up 11%\rRoad deaths increasing\rHeroes Highway already needs fixing\rREWARD: A functioning democracy\nKaieteur’s Savage Quote: “It is almost as if the opposition in Guyana is in [the PPP’s] fold, under its control”\nOuch.\n🌟 ACTUAL GOOD NEWS: HINTERLAND GETS CONNECTED Real Talk: Aishalton airstrip commissioned! This is genuinely awesome!\nWhat It Means:\nCommunities no longer isolated Lower transport costs Better healthcare access Educational opportunities Economic development Jags Aviation: Already lowering fares!\nChronicle Headline: “From isolation to integration” (Actually inspiring! Who wrote this?)\nGovernment: Actually delivering on hinterland development.\nUs: Pleasantly surprised! Do more of this, less of the 22-houses-per-day promises!\n📰 TODAY’S LESSONS Being indicted for fraud is \"oppression\" (write that down)\r69,000 volts \u003c concrete pump placement priority\rFewer crashes + more deaths = Guyana math\rTourists with cameras = hostiles\r22 houses/day = totally doable (if you're high)\rElectricity promises have expiration dates\rOpposition.exe has stopped responding\rHinterland development is actually happening! 🎉\r🔮 MONDAY’S PREDICTIONS 🔹 Mohameds file 47-page motion explaining how prosecution wanting an earlier date proves persecution\n🔹 Another contractor \"forgets\" about critical infrastructure (bingo anyone?)\n🔹 GPL updates slogan to \"Keeping the lights on DESPITE contractors\"\n🔹 Opposition spotted, immediately pretends to be mannequin\n🔹 VP doubles down: \"Actually, 80,000 houses in 2.5 years\"\n🔹 Chronicle publishes op-ed: \"Why Monday is actually the opposition's fault\"\n💭 WEEKEND WISDOM In a country where a man indicted for fraud writes op-eds about oppression while contractors treat power lines like suggestions and the government promises to build one house every 65 minutes for five straight years…\nAt least we’re building airstrips and the lights are still on.\nBarely.\nStay safe, Guyana. And contractors? FOR THE LOVE OF GPL, CALL BEFORE YOU BUILD! 📞\nThe Guyana Brief: Your daily dose of “wait, that actually happened?” 🇬🇾\nAll stories real. All outrage justified. All satire absolutely necessary.\n",

<p><strong>Mohamed&rsquo;s Grievances Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance companies won&rsquo;t cover his bulletproof vehicles anymore (the AUDACITY)</li>
<li>GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping him commit fraud, but details!)</li>
<li>His lands are being &ldquo;illegally occupied&rdquo; (by people who probably have actual legal papers)</li>

<p><strong>Act 1: The British Vlogger</strong></p>
<p>Ellis Riding arrives in Georgetown with a camera. Films garbage dumps, street people, and dangerous areas. Says Guyana is &ldquo;one of the most Third World places&rdquo; he&rsquo;s seen.</p>
<p><strong>Chronicle&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Publishes 1,000-word column calling him a &ldquo;10th-rate British foot-traveller&rdquo; with &ldquo;rotten mentality&rdquo; who&rsquo;s &ldquo;probably paid by the opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Chronicle&rsquo;s Defense:</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous in Miami too!&rdquo; (This is the new national slogan apparently)</p>
<p><strong>Act 2: The French Vlogger</strong></p>
<p>Antony D&rsquo;Oliveira is filming. Vendor Quacy McKay doesn&rsquo;t want to be filmed. Logical response? SLAP HIM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.</p>
