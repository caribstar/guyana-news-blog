Rise and shine! If you still hungover from Budget Day, don’t worry — the government already spending the money before you wake up properly. Today we dissecting Dr. Ashni Singh’s marathon presentation like a frog in a biology class. Grab your coffee strong — you going need it.\n📰 TOP STORY: Budget 2026 — $1.588 Trillion of Optimism The numbers are in, and they BIG: $1.588 trillion. That’s a 15% increase from last year, because apparently the economy growing at 14.3% and nobody told your salary.\nThe Headlines:\n$159.1 billion for housing — because 15,000 new house lots and 8,000 homes ain’t building themselves $745 million for agro-processing facilities in Parika and Lethem $316.5 million for special needs initiatives — including Guyana’s FIRST school for autistic children Corporate tax REMOVED for agriculture and agro-processing businesses VAT removed on locally made furniture and jewellery Dr. Singh: “Budget 2026 is positioned with the people at the centre.”\nTranslation: “We spending money. A LOT of money. Please vote for us in 2030.”\n🏠 HOUSING: 15,000 Lots, 8,000 Homes, Infinite Dreams The housing programme getting a $159.1 billion injection. The government plans to:\nDistribute 15,000 new house lots Build 8,000 homes Continue reducing the backlog outside Region Four Dr. Singh: “Our investments in housing are not just about providing shelter, but about creating safe, thriving communities where citizens can live with dignity, stability, and pride.”\nReality Check: Lot distribution faster than actual house construction. But at least you can camp on your land and look at the stars while you wait for building materials prices to drop.\n🌴 TOURISM: 453,489 Visitors and Counting Guyana welcomed a RECORD 453,489 visitors in 2025. The government now planning to:\nComplete the new Hospitality and Tourism Institute (training 700+ people) Add 56 communities to tourism circuits Expand “experiential and community-based” tourism Target diaspora for conferences, weddings, and reunions Also announced: Air Transat now flying twice weekly to Toronto with 796 additional seats per week.\nThe vision: Sustainable, diversified, people-centred tourism.\nThe reality: More hotels than we have airport capacity. But who’s counting?\n🌾 AGRICULTURE: The Agro-Processing Push The government allocating $745 million to continue the agro-processing expansion:\nNew facilities planned for Parika and Lethem Regional Food Hub at Yarrowkabra expected to complete this year 373 agro-processors already trained in packaging, labelling, and product presentation 25 Guyana Shop corners launched (one even in Barbados!) 15 agro-processing and 10 cold storage facilities already established nationwide.\nThe goal: Reduce post-harvest losses, boost exports, create rural jobs.\nTranslation: Mango season about to hit different.\n🏛️ BUSINESS REACTION: GCCI Says “Thank You” The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) is PLEASED. They praised:\nRemoval of corporate tax on agriculture/agro-processing Export allowance expansion to include timber VAT removal on local furniture and jewellery US$100 million for a zero-interest development bank GCCI: “A transformational effect on Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises.”\nTranslation: The private sector happy. The opposition… not consulted.\n🎓 SPECIAL NEEDS: Historic Investment One of the budget highlights: $316.5 million for special needs education and disability services.\nThis includes Guyana’s FIRST school for autistic students — to be built at the Cyril Potter College of Education campus.\nPresident Ali: The measures are designed “to ensure greatest impact on people.”\nThis is genuinely good news. No jokes here. Well done.\n📊 THE NUMBERS AT A GLANCE Budget Item Amount What It Means Total Budget $1.588 trillion 15% increase Housing $159.1 billion 15,000 lots, 8,000 homes Agro-processing $745 million Parika, Lethem facilities Special Needs $316.5 million First autism school Economic Growth (2025) 14.3% Oil doing the heavy lifting Tourist Arrivals (2025) 453,489 Record breaking 🗣️ OPPOSITION CORNER: Still Waiting for Consultation Remember how the government consulted the Private Sector Commission, GCCI, and every business group before the budget?\nThe opposition? Not so much.\nAPNU Leader Aubrey Norton (from two weeks ago): “The government doesn’t engage, because in their opinion, they will look as though they are taking ideas from us.”\nMP Sharma Solomon: Claims 58% poverty rate.\nNorton’s prediction: “I expect the same old budget.”\nResult: Same old budget. But bigger.\n🎯 ECONOMIST TAKE: “People Sensitive, Very Unique” Economist Richard Rambarran broke down the budget:\n31 measures directly impacting people’s lives 14.3% growth is “a number to certainly hold on to” Budget grew from $1.38 trillion to $1.588 trillion Private Sector Commission’s Dr. Komal Singh: “Very unique budget… you can visualize where we will be in the next five years.”\n☁️ FORECAST Tomorrow: More budget analysis. Opposition still searching for the door to the National Assembly. The $100,000 cash grant quietly becoming Guyanese folklore.\nThe Guyana Daily Brief: All the news that’s fit to satirize.\nCritical analysis of Guyana’s political landscape. For a pro-government perspective, see Uncle Ramesh’s take.\n","wordCount":"789","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-01-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-27T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-27-daily-brief/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The Guyana Daily Brief - Tuesday, January 27, 2026</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 27, 2026</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=-good-morning-guyana>☀️ Good Morning, Guyana!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-good-morning-guyana>#</a></h2><p>Rise and shine!
