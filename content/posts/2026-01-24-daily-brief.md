## 🏛️ OPPOSITION LEADER DRAMA: THE LONGEST ELECTION EVER

**The Headlines:**
- APNU says they'll likely abstain from Opposition Leader vote
- Mohamed says he's "scared" ahead of Monday's vote
- APNU warns cut borrowing for Budget 2026 as oil prices slide

**The Brief:**
So Monday's the big day, right? Wrong. We've been saying "Monday's the big day" since September. Azruddin Mohamed, the US-indicted gold dealer who somehow controls a quarter of the National Assembly, is apparently "scared" about the Opposition Leader vote. Scared of what? Losing? Winning? Having to explain to his American lawyers why he's running a country instead of running from an extradition warrant?

Meanwhile, APNU says they'll "likely abstain" from voting. Imagine having 12 seats in Parliament and your big political strategy is to... not vote. That's like going to a cook-up and just standing in the corner watching everyone eat. 

But wait — Guyana Times says APNU "will not oppose" Mohamed. So they're not voting FOR him, not voting AGAINST him... they're just vibes-ing in the chamber? 

The Western diplomats met with Speaker Nadir yesterday for an "interesting" meeting. Interesting how? Like "interesting" when your mother-in-law says your cooking is "interesting"? We need details, people!

## 💰 BUDGET 2026: ANOTHER "LARGEST EVER" INCOMING

**The Headlines:**
- APNU warns against "reckless" borrowing with oil prices sliding
- Budget 2026 to be presented Monday
- Editorial: "The Budget Test"

**The Brief:**
Here we go again! Budget 2026 drops Monday, and you already know what Finance Minister Ashni Singh gon say: "This is the LARGEST budget in Guyana's history!" 

You know what else is the largest in Guyana's history? Our expectations for change. And our disappointment when we realize the money still going to the same contractors with the same overruns on the same projects.

APNU raising alarm about oil prices dropping and government borrowing too much. They saying another "largest budget" would be a "reckless gamble." But let's be real — APNU warning the government about fiscal responsibility is like letting the man who crashed your car teach you to drive.

Kaieteur's editorial asking whether government will pass "The Budget Test." Spoiler alert: The test is multiple choice and all the answers are "more billions for infrastructure projects that never finish on time."

Minister Manickchand telling everybody that Guyana can't develop if we don't fix our waste disposal. She's right, you know. We does talk about becoming the Dubai of the Caribbean, but Dubai doesn't have goats grazing on garbage piles in the middle of the highway.

The Solid Waste Management Bill consultation happening. Finally! A whole Bill just for garbage. Though some people would argue we already have plenty garbage... in Parliament.
