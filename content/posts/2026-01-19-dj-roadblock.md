Bai, de people of West Ruimveldt CRYING. Residents been telling de newspapers for YEARS dat de roads breaking up dey vehicles! The Chronicle reported it. Stabroek reported it. EVERYBODY reported it.

De M&CC know about it. Officials say dey "aware." 

AWARE? Me AWARE dat I hungry, but dat don't mean food appearing on me plate! Awareness don't fix roads!

**Pro tip:** If you MUST drive West Ruimveldt, follow de goats. Dem know which holes to avoid.

### De Abreu Street, Kitty - Pothole Paradise

Dis street been bad since BEFORE some ah you was born. Residents telling de papers it ain't properly fixed in YEARS! 

Private school deh there. Grocery shop deh there. Auto repair shop deh there — and TRUST ME, de auto repair business BOOMING because everybody vehicle getting destroy on dat street!

De potholes got potholes. Is like inception but fuh road damage.

**Rating:** 🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️ (5 out of 5 potholes)

## 🟡 PROCEED WITH CAUTION

### Regent Street - De Swimming Pool

Every time rain fall, Regent Street become Olympic swimming venue. People wading through ankle-high water like is normal Tuesday. 

De pumps working, dey say. All 13 pumps in Georgetown operational, de Minister confirm.

But somehow... SOMEHOW... Regent Street still flooding. 

Is like de water got personal beef wid Regent Street. Water see Regent Street and say "YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY I STAYING!"

---

### Bel Air Park - "Posh" But Still Flooded

You think because you living in de fancy areas you safe? NAH! Even de nice neighborhoods flooding when rain fall!

Money cyaan stop water, family. Yuh expensive vehicle still gotta wade through de same flood as everybody else!

---

### Sheriff Street - De Eternal Crater

Remember dat pothole by de fast food place? SHE STILL DEH! And she GROWING! 

I hear people naming potholes now. One crater so old, it should have voting rights!

**Avoidance strategy:** Hug de left side, say a prayer, and accelerate.

---

## 🟢 SURPRISINGLY PASSABLE

### Vlissengen Road 

Looking decent today! But don't get comfortable — give it 10 minutes. Something WILL happen. Funeral procession, breakdown, random cow crossing... de road always got surprises.

### East Bank Highway

Weekend traffic light, so you might actually MOVE today. Enjoy it. Come Monday, you back to suffering.

## 🚗 GENERAL TRAFFIC OBSERVATIONS

**De Parking Situation:**
Why people parking like dey fighting with de parking space? Some vehicles taking up THREE spots at de market! Others parking ON de sidewalk like sidewalk is extra lane!

Guyana needs parking lessons, not just driving lessons!

**De Indicator Epidemic:**
Indicators exist, people! Dat little stick by de steering wheel? USE IT! Sally don't have psychic powers to know you turning!

**De Rush Hour Reality:**
If you leaving office at 5 PM, just bring a book. Or snacks. Or both. Because you sitting in traffic till at least 6:30.

## 💡 DJ ROADBLOCK'S TIPS

1. **Rainy season coming** - Check yuh wipers NOW, not when you cyaan see nothing

2. **Keep snacks in yuh car** - Traffic jam don't care if you hungry

3. **Download some music** - Because radio signal WEAK in some of dese areas

4. **If you see cones** - Turn around. Just turn around. De cones multiplying and nobody know when dat "work" finishing.

5. **Check yuh suspension** - If you driving Georgetown regularly, budget for repairs!

## 🏆 INFRASTRUCTURE HALL OF SHAME

This week's nominations go to:

1. **De Drainage System** - For giving de impression of working while flooding continues

2. **De Road Marking Crew** - For lines so faded, you need faith to find yuh lane

3. **De Traffic Light Timer** - Who programmed dese? You get green light for 5 seconds, then red for 5 MINUTES!

4. **De Pothole Filler** - For patches dat last approximately ONE RAINFALL before disappearing

---

## FINAL THOUGHT

Georgetown below sea level. We know dis. De Dutch build we drainage system centuries ago. And somehow, in 2026, with oil money flowing, we STILL can't drive from Kitty to Stabroek without needing a mechanic appointment after.

De government making progress, yes. New projects happening, yes. But de BASIC roads in RESIDENTIAL AREAS? Still waiting!

DJ Roadblock not blaming any specific person — dis is a SYSTEMS problem dat need SYSTEMS solutions!

But hey — at least de pumps "working"! 

Even if de roads ain't.

**Stay safe out deh, Guyana! Dis is DJ Roadblock signing off. Watch de potholes, respect de traffic lights, and remember — if de water rising, TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN!**

**BEEP BEEP! 🚗📻**
