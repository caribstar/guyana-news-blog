### What Makes a True Patriot?

Dr. Perseverance understands that being a Guyanese Patriot means more than just doing your job. It means:

✅ Always finding something positive to say about wait times

✅ Never questioning why the X-ray machine has been "coming next month" for three years

✅ Smiling in photos with visiting dignitaries even when you haven't slept in 36 hours

✅ Believing that "challenges" are just "opportunities for growth and photo opportunities"
