## &#128483; THE BIG STORY: Opposition Leader Vote Finally Scheduled

**Speaker Calls Meeting, Then Calls Candidate a Fugitive**

After weeks of constitutional hand-wringing, Speaker Manzoor Nadir has *reluctantly* announced that opposition MPs will meet Monday, January 26th at 10 AM to elect a Leader of the Opposition.

But here's where it gets spicy: while making the announcement, Nadir basically called the presumptive winner - WIN Leader Azruddin Mohamed - an "international fugitive" facing US extradition. He then asked everyone to preserve "the dignity of the house" and "the sanctity" of the responsibility.

**Translation:** "I'm legally required to do this, but I want everyone to know I'm unhappy about it."

WIN holds 16 of 29 opposition seats, so unless APNU pulls off a miracle coalition, Mohamed is your next Opposition Leader. A man simultaneously running for the highest opposition office and running from US prosecutors. Only in Guyana could this be normal.

## &#9728;&#65039; ENERGY: Linden Getting Solar Farms

**15 Megawatts of "Clean, Cheap Power" Coming**

Region 10 residents gathered at Watooka Lodge on Tuesday to hear about three solar farms being built at Retrieve, Block 37, and Dakoura. GUYSOL officials promised 15MW of power, lower electricity costs, and reduced government subsidies.

Even APNU MP Sharma Solomon showed up and said nice things. When the opposition compliments a government project, you know either:
a) The project is genuinely good, or
b) It's election season

Construction starts Q1 2026, wrapping up Q1 2027. The US$83 million comes from Norway's forest money - yes, the same money Guyana earned by not cutting down trees. We're literally being paid to not do something, and it's working out great.

## &#128465;&#65039; CRISIS: Georgetown's Garbage Emergency

**Mayor Declares Emergency, Minister Promises "Relief"**

The Georgetown Mayor and City Council declared a "limited state of solid waste emergency" on Monday because apparently the capital is drowning in garbage. Non-essential city staff are being reassigned to cleanup duty.

Local Government Minister Priya Manickchand responded on Tuesday: "You will see relief."

When? How? From where? Details were apparently not essential. But relief is coming. Soon. Maybe. 

The strategy involves asking central government for "financial and other forms of support." Translation: "We need money and we need it yesterday."

If you've been wondering why Georgetown smells like a landfill, it's because... well, parts of it basically are.

## &#128110; CRIME & COURTS: The Mohameds Saga Continues

**US Veteran Prosecutor Now Handling Case**

The extradition case against gold traders Azruddin and Nazar Mohamed (yes, the same Azruddin about to become Opposition Leader) continues grinding forward. A US veteran prosecutor known for handling major Venezuelan bribery forfeitures is now on the case.

Lawyers are clashing over allegations of bias and questions about ministerial authority to approve extradition proceedings. Chief Justice (ag) Navindra Singh will rule February 2nd on whether Home Affairs Minister Walrond even had authority to issue the "authority to proceed."

The Mohameds maintain their innocence. The US maintains its interest. The rest of us maintain our popcorn supply.

## &#128680; SCANDAL: Police Academy Under Investigation

**"Serious" Allegations of Sexual Exploitation**

The Ministry of Home Affairs announced a probe into "serious" allegations of sexual exploitation, abuse of authority, and misconduct at the Guyana Police Force Academy.

The statement says the administration "immediately directed" the Criminal Investigation Department and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate. No details on what triggered the investigation, but "immediately" suggests someone somewhere is very worried.

When the people training our future police officers need investigating, you have to wonder: who trains the trainers' trainers?

## &#128663; INFRASTRUCTURE: Eccles Roundabout Chaos

**Bridge Open, Traffic Worse**

The new Demerara River Bridge is doing its job... most of the time. Off-peak hours are smooth. But during rush hour? Eccles Roundabout has become, in the words of Kaieteur News, "the main chokehold of the East Bank."

The government apparently realized a little late that maybe - just maybe - an overpass at Eccles should have been built *before* opening a bridge that invited thousands more vehicles to the party.

Peak hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM) now feature what locals describe as "just enough movement to keep hope alive and tempers boiling at the same time."

## &#127973; HEALTH: Lima Hospital Gets Management Committee

**New Committee, New Vision, Same Challenges**

Health Minister Dr. Frank Anthony met with a newly formed Management Committee for Lima Regional Hospital on Tuesday. The plan: upgrade infrastructure, improve service delivery, reduce waiting times, and "enhance overall health outcomes."

The committee includes regional health officers, educators, religious leaders, and community representatives. It's the kind of diverse stakeholder group that either produces great results or excellent excuses.

Time will tell which one.

## &#128240; MEDIA DRAMA: Freddie vs. Stabroek News

**Chronicle Columnist Unleashes on Rival Paper**

Freddie Kissoon used his Guyana Chronicle column today to absolutely *torch* Stabroek News and its columnists. Words used include: "despicable," "repellent," "pro-imperialist," and "sycophantic eulogy."

He also took shots at Forward Guyana's Amanza Walton-Desir and the comment section of Stabroek News' website, which he described as "psychotic anti-government pyrotechnics."

When columnists start beefing with each other across newspapers, you know content is slow. Or feelings are real. Probably both.
