## Bai, Uncle Ramesh Know How to Read Statistics

So police say crime down 25.5%, and immediately de critics start with "But murders up 11%!"

**Uncle Ramesh say:** Let's do de PROPER math, not de cherry-picking math.

**What went DOWN in 2025:**
- Armed robbery with firearms: down 29.4%
- Robbery with violence: down 34.1%  
- Burglary: down 70.1% (SEVENTY PERCENT!)
- Rape: down 12.6%
- Larceny: down 39.5%
- Overall serious crime: down 25.5%

**What went up:**
- Murders: up 11.1% (13 more cases)

Uncle Ramesh do de math: **Dat's HUNDREDS of crimes prevented versus 13 additional murders.** Both bad, yes. But you can't ignore de MASSIVE progress because of ONE category.

**Uncle Ramesh analogy:** If you student bring home report card with A's in 7 subjects and B in one subject, you celebrate de A's WHILE working on de B. You don't say "De whole report card garbage!"

Crime going down 25% is HUGE SUCCESS. Murder rate need work, agreed. But don't let de critics pretend government doing nothing when de evidence RIGHT HERE.

## $123 Million Search & Rescue Is SMART Investment

Uncle Ramesh VERY impressed with dis one. Government spend $123 million on new Search and Rescue system, and Uncle Ramesh say **FINALLY someone thinking about SAFETY!**

**Why dis important:**
- We got offshore oil operations worth BILLIONS
- We got increased air traffic (development!)
- We got hinterland communities that need emergency response
- When accident happen, MINUTES save lives

16 people trained by Canadian experts. Real-time coordination. Modern technology. **Dis is how you run a country in 2026, not 1986!**

**And Uncle Ramesh ask de critics:** When was de last time PREVIOUS government invest in emergency response? Uncle Ramesh will wait...

*Crickets...*

Exactly! Easy to criticize, hard to BUILD.

## Traffic Enforcement Finally WORKING

Critics complaining about 3,107 traffic violations in one week. Uncle Ramesh say: **GOOD! Catch ALL of them!**

**De numbers:**
- 964 speeders caught
- 168 motorcyclists without helmets caught  
- 151 dangerous parking caught

Uncle Ramesh ask: You prefer police DON'T catch them? You prefer we just let people drive reckless and kill innocent people?

**Enforcement mean police WORKING!** If you don't want to be part of de 3,107, simple solution: **FOLLOW DE LAW!**

Uncle Ramesh notice critics never complain when THEY get cut off by speeding car or nearly hit by helmetless biker. But when police actually ENFORCE de law? "Oh, harassment!"

Please.

## President Ali Delivering on Financial Reform

President say financial system modernization coming "in the coming weeks," and critics laughing. Uncle Ramesh say: **At least he SAYING it instead of IGNORING it!**

**Previous government:** Promised things, delivered nothing.

**Current government:** Promise things, sometimes take longer than expected, but DELIVER.

Uncle Ramesh prefer slow progress over NO progress. Stock market modernization, financial inclusion, investment opportunities for ordinary Guyanese—all GOOD things dat previous government never even MENTIONED.

**Uncle Ramesh prediction:** When it happen, same critics will say "Took too long!" instead of "Thank you." Watch.

## Airfare Reduction Shows Government Strategy WORKING

Uncle Ramesh LOVE dis success story:
1. Government rehabilitate airstrips (COMPLETED!)
2. President call for fare reductions
3. Trans Guyana drop 7%, Air Services drop 9%

**Dis is RESULTS!** Government invest in infrastructure, private sector respond, PEOPLE benefit.

Uncle Ramesh ask: When opposition was in power, airfares went UP or DOWN? Uncle Ramesh remember airfares going UP because airstrips falling apart!

**Cause and effect:** Good government policy = Better service + Lower prices.

Uncle Ramesh wish critics would acknowledge SUCCESS when dey see it instead of always looking for problems.

## CANU Doing Excellent Work

Customs Anti-Narcotic Unit report for 2025 show:
- Major drug seizures
- New Early Warning System launched  
- 27 training programmes completed
- Enhanced regional cooperation

**Uncle Ramesh proud!** While some countries becoming transit points for drugs, Guyana fighting BACK with intelligence, training, and modern systems.

Critics quiet about dis one because dey can't find nothing to complain about. When government doing something RIGHT, suddenly nobody want to talk about it.

## Court Backlog Easing After YEARS of Investment

126 cases for January-March Assizes, down from HUNDREDS before. DPP say backlog declining for FIVE YEARS straight.

**Uncle Ramesh translation:** Government been investing in judiciary CONSISTENTLY, and results SHOWING.

Yes, some cases still waiting long time. But PROGRESS is PROGRESS. You don't fix decades of backlog overnight, but you KEEP WORKING at it until it fixed.

**Critics want instant results.** Uncle Ramesh understand PROCESS.

---

## Uncle Ramesh's Bottom Line

Crime down 25% overall (massive success!). $123M invested in emergency response (smart planning!). Traffic enforcement catching violators (law and order!). Airfares dropping because infrastructure delivered (results!). CANU fighting drugs effectively (national security!). Court backlog shrinking (justice improving!).

**De pattern Uncle Ramesh seeing:** Government making strategic investments, delivering results, and improving systems. Critics focusing on de 5% dat still need work while ignoring de 95% dat's WORKING.

Uncle Ramesh prefer it this way: **Acknowledge progress while working on challenges. Celebrate success while addressing problems.**

Is everything perfect? No! But Uncle Ramesh ask: **Show me de perfect country!**

*Still waiting...*

**Exactly.**

---

*Uncle Ramesh going to enjoy he safer streets (crime down 25%!), knowing dat if he have emergency, $123M search and rescue system got he back. Dat's called PROGRESS, people!*

🇬🇾 **Keep moving forward, Guyana. De numbers don't lie—only de critics do.**

---

***Reading the Other Side:** De critics will focus on murders being up and say all de progress ain't real. Read de Monday Brief for dat doom and gloom perspective.

Uncle Ramesh is a fictional character representing pro-government perspectives. His views are satirical commentary. But dem crime reduction numbers? Dem REAL. Check de statistics!*
