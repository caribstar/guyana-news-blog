## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: MOTTLEY CALLS ELECTION FOR FEBRUARY 11

Prime Minister Mia Mottley has officially called general elections for February 11, 2026, setting up what promises to be an intense three-week campaign.

Parliament was dissolved on January 19, with Nomination Day set for January 27.

The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) completed its slate of 30 candidates with the nomination of attorney Michael Lashley — yes, the same Michael Lashley who defected from the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) last year.

Mottley is pointing to her economic record: 17 consecutive quarters of growth, record-low unemployment, and historically high foreign reserves.

"Whilst there is work to be done, there is work for the Barbados Labour Party and its soldiers to do," she told supporters, adding: "When I start to call on you, I don't want you to tell me that you are tired."

**The opposition's challenge:** Can the DLP convince Bajans that it's time for change when the numbers say the economy is doing well?

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: KAMLA'S TRICKY BALANCING ACT

Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar is navigating turbulent waters after the UNC's victory over Stuart Young's PNM in the April 2025 elections.

The big issue? Trinidad's relationship with CARICOM amid the US military action in Venezuela.

Persad-Bissessar has publicly differed with other Caribbean leaders on the US deployment in the Southern Caribbean, defended cooperation with Washington on anti-drug operations, and questioned CARICOM's reliability as a partner.

Meanwhile, former PM Stuart Young is urging Trinidadians to "reject divisiveness" in 2026.

"Never let anyone, or any agenda, push you towards divisiveness and hate," Young wrote in a New Year's message. "Whether it's hating our Caribbean brothers and sisters, hating your neighbour, or even hating our own country."

**The subtext:** Trinidad is caught between regional solidarity and national interests, and the cracks are showing.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $415 MILLION FOR HURRICANE MELISSA RECOVERY

The IMF has approved Jamaica's request for emergency financial assistance of approximately US$415 million to help the country recover from Hurricane Melissa.

The devastating storm caused significant damage across the island, and this balance-of-payments support is crucial for reconstruction efforts.

Prime Minister Andrew Holness is simultaneously urging Jamaicans to "focus on building a future at home" amid news that the US is indefinitely pausing immigrant visas for several Caribbean nations.

Jamaica's economy grew 5.1% in the July-September 2025 quarter compared to the same period last year, showing resilience despite the natural disaster.

## ✈️ CARIBBEAN AIRLINES: MAJOR RESTRUCTURING

Caribbean Airlines is making significant changes to its regional operations in early 2026:

**What's happening:**
- Suspending routes between Trinidad, Barbados, Tortola, and San Juan
- Suspending services linking Dominica with Puerto Rico
- **Closing its Barbados operational hub in February 2026**

Aircraft and crew currently based in Barbados will move to Trinidad while continuing to serve Barbados routes.

**What this means for travelers:**
- Longer connection times
- More complex routing
- Potentially higher fares on some routes

The airline has struggled with financial sustainability, following earlier cancellations of Jamaica-Florida routes in November 2025.

**Silver lining:** Budget carrier Avelo Airlines is expanding into the Caribbean with new direct flights from New Orleans, Tampa, and Providence to Cancún, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

## 🛂 US VISA SCRUTINY TIGHTENS FOR CARIBBEAN NATIONALS

Multiple Caribbean nations are facing stricter US visa processes in 2026 as Washington cracks down on birth tourism:

**Affected countries:** Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, and others.

**What to expect:**
- Enhanced visa interviews
- Deeper examination of travel intent
- Potential processing delays
- Questions about medical plans and maternity costs

Pregnant applicants will need to demonstrate their visit aligns with "genuine tourism or family visiting, not maternity."

Existing visas issued before January 1, 2026, generally remain valid.

## 🇭🇹 HAITI: MEDIATION EFFORTS HIT SNAG

Haitian Bishop Pierre-André Dumas has withdrawn from a proposed national mediation process aimed at preventing political instability ahead of the end of the Transitional Presidential Council's term.

With Haiti's political crisis continuing, the country remains under pressure from gangs and lacking stable governance.

The TPS (Temporary Protected Status) termination hearing for Haitians in the US continues, adding to uncertainty for the diaspora community.

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

The Caribbean in January 2026 is a region in transition:

**Barbados** is heading to polls with the economy as the central issue. **Trinidad** is navigating its new government's foreign policy direction. **Jamaica** is rebuilding from a hurricane while watching US immigration policy closely. And the entire region is feeling the ripple effects of US-Venezuela tensions.

Meanwhile, Caribbean Airlines' restructuring reminds us that connectivity — the lifeblood of regional integration — is always precarious for small island economies.
