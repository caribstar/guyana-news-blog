Nephew and niece dem,

Is Uncle Ramesh here, writing to allyuh from Queens where de snow finally stop and me could see de sidewalk again. But even with dis cold weather, nothing warming me heart more than watching Speaker Nadir tell de TRUTH to dese opposition people!

## SPEAKER NADIR IS A NATIONAL HERO

Me reading de papers this morning and me nearly spill me chai tea when me see what Speaker Nadir say. De man basically tell de opposition: "Go ahead and elect yuh fugitive if yuh want, but don't come crying to me when de international community laugh at we."

**DIS IS EXACTLY WHAT GUYANA NEED!**

Yuh see, back in de day, nobody would dare tell de opposition de truth. People was scared. But dis Speaker? He got backbone! He tell dem straight: "If opposition Members of Parliament feel it morally right to elect an international fugitive, then the stain on our Parliament and our country rests solely with them."

Me nephew Vikram call me and say, "Uncle, yuh think he being too harsh?"

HARSH?! De man being CHARITABLE! If it was me, me woulda say plenty more! 

De opposition getting a FREE WARNING here. Speaker Nadir basically telling dem: "Don't embarrass yuhself and de country." And wha dem doing? Getting vex! Instead of saying "thank you for de advice" dem getting defensive!

Is like when yuh mother tell yuh not to touch de hot pot and yuh get mad at she instead of being grateful yuh still got fingerprints!

## CHARRANDASS MAKING TIKTOKS NOW?

So me hear dat Charrandass — yes, DAT Charrandass — making TikTok videos criticizing de Attorney General about legal terminology.

TIKTOK! 

De man who couldn't read de room in 2018 now trying to tell Anil Nandlall he don't know what "fugitive offender" mean?!

And wha happen? Nandlall pull out de ACTUAL LAW and read it on national television. Chapter 10:04. Word for word. De man didn't even have to think about it — he just opened de book and showed Charrandass what de law ACTUALLY say.

Dis is why you don't challenge lawyers on legal terminology when yuh not a lawyer. Is like me trying to tell de chef at de roti shop how to make dhalpuri. Stay in yuh lane!

## BELGIUM WANT TO BUILD WE PORTS!

Now, let we talk about GOOD news. Belgium — BELGIUM! — sending delegation to Guyana to talk about helping we build ports!

Yuh know how big de Port of Antwerp is? Is one of de BIGGEST in Europe! And dem want to work with WE!

Why? Because under President Ali leadership, Guyana becoming de Caribbean POWERHOUSE. Everybody want piece of dis action now. Belgium, IATA for de airport, investment coming from all over de world.

Me neighbor Harold — he from Jamaica — he tell me de other day, "Boy, Guyana really taking off eh?" 

YES HAROLD! Because we have COMPETENT LEADERSHIP! Not people making TikTok videos about words dem don't understand!

## DE COCAINE BUST SHOW DE SYSTEM WORKING

Some people see 70kg cocaine bust and say "crime bad." Me see 70kg cocaine bust and say "CANU WORKING!"

Yuh think dem catch dis much product by accident? NO! Is intelligence. Is hard work. Is coordination.

Under dis government, we catching more drug traffickers than ever. Why? Because de system FUNCTIONING. De government investing in security, in technology, in training.

Three man in jail, one more facing charges. Dat is RESULTS.

But watch, de opposition papers gon spin dis as "drug crisis." Nah nah nah. Dis is ENFORCEMENT working. Big difference!

## ME QUESTION FOR DE OPPOSITION

Me have one simple question for WIN and APNU and whoever else calling demself opposition:

If Azruddin Mohamed so confident he innocent, why he fighting de extradition? Why he not just go to America, clear he name, and come back a free man? 

Me, personally? If somebody accuse me of something me didn't do, me RUNNING to clear me name. Me not hiding behind lawyers and constitutional arguments. Me going straight to de court and saying "HERE ME IS! PROVE IT!"

But dat not happening, eh? Instead we getting delay after delay after constitutional challenge after court case after excuse after excuse...

Me grandmother used to say: "When fowl cock running from de pot, he know something hot waiting for he."

Just saying.

## IMMIGRATION NEWS FROM UP HERE

Quick update from de diaspora: Trinidad had election and Kamla back in power. Barbados having election February 11. De whole Caribbean in political season.

And wha happening? Every country looking at Guyana and saying "how we could be like dem?" Because we have stability. We have growth. We have LEADERSHIP.

Meanwhile, some people want put a man facing US charges in charge of de Opposition. 

Yuh can't make dis up.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Look, me know some of allyuh gon say "Uncle Ramesh, yuh too biased." And yuh know what? Maybe me is. But me biased toward COMMON SENSE.

Speaker Nadir tell de truth. De AG know he law. CANU catching criminals. Belgium want to invest. IATA want to help de airport.

ALL OF DIS IS GOOD NEWS.

De only bad news is some people STILL trying to put a wanted man in Parliament as Opposition Leader. And even DAT coming with a warning label now, courtesy of Speaker Nadir.

So me say: Thank you, Speaker. Thank you for having de courage to say what everybody thinking.

And to de opposition: De man give yuh warning. Whether yuh take it or not, dat is on YOU.

Allyuh take care,

**Uncle Ramesh**

*Forever PPP*
