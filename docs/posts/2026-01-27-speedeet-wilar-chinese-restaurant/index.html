Street, Kitty\n“Speedeet! SPEEDEET!”\nWilar come running down Pike Street like somebody chasing he with a cutlass. But he face wasn’t scared — he face was EXCITED.\n“Wha happen?” Speedeet look up from de marble game he was winning against Little Sanjay.\n“Me uncle know de man who own de Chinese restaurant! De one next to Kitty Cinema church on Alexander Street!”\nSpeedeet eyes get big. EVERYBODY know dat restaurant. De smell alone could make you forget you had lunch already.\n“So?”\n“SO? He say he could carry we inside! INSIDE de kitchen!”\nLittle Sanjay marble roll away forgotten. Speedeet was already on he feet.\n“Leh we go!”\n🚶 DE WALK TO ALEXANDER STREET De two boys walk fast-fast down de road. Wilar uncle, Mr. Doodnauth, was waiting by de restaurant door looking important.\n“Alright boys, Mr. Chen say we could go in de back. But NO TOUCHING. You hear me? NO. TOUCHING.”\n“Yes Uncle,” Wilar say, all innocent.\nSpeedeet just nod. He fingers already twitching.\nMr. Chen appear at de door — a small man with a big smile and a apron that look like it see more battles than de Guyana Defence Force.\n“Ah! Doodnauth! Come, come! Bring de boys!”\nAnd just so, dey was IN.\n🍗 DE KITCHEN Speedeet thought he know what a kitchen look like. He mother kitchen had a stove, a pot, and sometimes a lizard on de wall.\nDIS was something else.\nRows and ROWS of chicken hanging neat-neat on racks. Golden brown. Glistening. Looking like dey posing for a photograph.\n“Oh gosh…” Speedeet whisper.\nDe SMELL hit he like a wave. Garlic. Ginger. Soy sauce. Something sweet. Something savory. All of it mixing together into one beautiful cloud dat wrap around he brain and squeeze.\n“You boys hungry?” Mr. Chen ask, already knowing de answer.\nWilar nod so hard he glasses nearly fly off.\n🥡 DE TASTING Mr. Chen start pulling out dish after dish.\nSweet and sour pork. Wilar couldn’t eat dat, but Speedeet demolished it.\nChicken chow mein. Both boys attack it like dey never see food before.\nFried wontons. Gone in seconds.\nAnd then…\nMr. Chen bring out a big plate of fried rice.\n“Dis,” he say with pride, “is me SPECIAL Chop Suey Fried Rice. Secret recipe.”\nSpeedeet look at de rice. It had everything. Chicken pieces. Vegetables. Egg. Shrimp.\nAnd something else.\nSomething… unfamiliar.\n👀 DE DISCOVERY Speedeet was shoveling rice into he mouth when he fork hit something strange.\nHe look down.\nHe squint.\nHe lean closer.\n“Wilar…”\n“Wha?”\n“Wilar, look at dis.”\nWilar push up he glasses and peer into Speedeet plate.\nSitting right there, mixed in with de rice and de vegetables and de regular chicken pieces…\nWas a CHICKEN HEAD.\nComplete with de little red comb on top.\n“OH GOSH!” Wilar jump back like de head was gon bite he.\nSpeedeet just stare at it.\nDe chicken head stare back.\nWell, not really. De eyes was closed. But it FELT like it was staring.\n🤔 DE DECISION Mr. Doodnauth and Mr. Chen was deep in conversation by de freezer, not paying attention.\nWilar was backing away slow-slow. “Speedeet, put it down. PUT IT DOWN.”\nBut Speedeet mind was racing.\nHe had eat chicken leg before. Chicken wing. Chicken breast. Chicken back. He mother even make chicken foot soup one time.\nBut chicken HEAD?\nDis was new territory.\nDis was ADVENTURE.\n“Wilar,” Speedeet say slowly, “you ever eat chicken head before?”\n“NO! And I not starting today!”\nSpeedeet look at de head again. De little comb was actually kinda crispy looking. Like a tiny red chip.\nHe think about all de times he tell Wilar to be brave. All de times he say “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” All de times he climb de mango tree first.\nHow he could call heself SPEEDEET — de bravest boy on Pike Street — if he scared of a little chicken head?\nBesides, de comb was looking kinda interesting. Soft. Reddish. Like a little rubbery crown.\n😋 DE MOMENT OF TRUTH Speedeet take a deep breath.\nHe pick up de chicken head with he fork.\nWilar cover he eyes. “I can’t watch. I CAN’T WATCH.”\nSpeedeet open he mouth.\nAnd he eat it.\n…\n…\n…\n“Well?” Wilar peek through he fingers.\nSpeedeet was chewing. Slow. Thoughtful. Like a food critic on TV.\nHe eyes get wide.\nDe comb wasn’t crispy like he expected. It was SOFT. Chewy. Like nothing he ever taste before. It had dis unusual texture dat bounce around in he mouth — rubbery but in a GOOD way. He chew on it delightfully, exploring every bit of de strange new sensation.\n“It… it actually NICE,” he say, genuinely surprised.\n“WHAT?!”\n“De comb soft and chewy like… like… I don’t even know what to compare it to! And de rest taste like regular chicken but more… more CHICKENY. But dat COMB, Wilar! De texture! It like chewing on a little piece of magic!”\nWilar look like he was gon faint.\nSpeedeet grin and take another big scoop of de fried rice.\n“Wilar, you missing out. Dis is de best fried rice I ever eat in me life!”\n🏃 DE AFTERMATH When dey finally leave de restaurant, Speedeet belly was FULL and he mind was BLOWN.\n“Wilar, you know what dis mean?”\n“Dat you crazy?”\n“No! It mean we been eating chicken WRONG dis whole time! We been throwing away de best parts!”\nWilar shake he head. “Speedeet, I not eating no chicken head. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not EVER.”\n“Suit yourself.” Speedeet pat he belly satisfied. “More for me.”\nDey walk back toward Pike Street, de afternoon sun warm on dey backs.\n“You know,” Wilar say after a while, “you really eat dat thing, eh?”\n“Yup.”\n“De whole head?”\n“De WHOLE head. Comb and all.”\nWilar was quiet for a moment. Den he start to laugh.\n“Speedeet, you is really something else, you know dat?”\nSpeedeet grin. “Dat’s why dey call me SPEEDEET, bai. First to try everything. Scared of NOTHING.”\n“Except Miss Doreen.”\n“…Except Miss Doreen. But dat woman have a BROOM.”\n🍚 DE LESSON Dat night, Speedeet lay in he bed thinking about de day.\nHe had seen de inside of a real Chinese restaurant kitchen. He had taste dishes he never even know existed. He had eat a CHICKEN HEAD and live to tell de tale.\nAnd dat comb? Dat soft, chewy, unusual comb? He was STILL thinking about de texture. How it bounce in he mouth. How different it was from anything else he ever eat.\nLife was full of surprises, he realize. You never know what you gon find when you brave enough to try something new.\nEven if dat something new got a little red comb on top.\nHe smile in de darkness.\nTomorrow, he would tell de whole Pike Street crew about he adventure. Little Sanjay wouldn’t believe he. Keisha would say he lying. Ravi would probably dare he to do it again.\nAnd he would.\nBecause dat’s what Speedeet do.\nHe go first.\nHe try everything.\nHe eat de chicken head.\nAnd he enjoy every bite.\nTHE END\nNext time on Speedeet \u0026 Wilar: De boys discover what REALLY in de black pudding at de market. Wilar might never eat again.\nSpeedeet \u0026 Wilar are two 12-year-old best friends from Pike Street, Kitty, Georgetown. Speedeet is the brave one who jumps first.
