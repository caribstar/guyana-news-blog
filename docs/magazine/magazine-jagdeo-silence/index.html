We investigate what\u0026rsquo;s really happening behind closed doors.","keywords":["Politics","Jagdeo","Analysis","Investigation"],"articleBody":"For three consecutive weeks, the podium at Freedom House has remained empty on Wednesday afternoons. No customary press conference. No fiery rebuttals. No multi-hour Q\u0026A sessions that have become Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo’s trademark.\nThe silence is deafening.\nAnd in Guyanese politics, silence from Bharrat Jagdeo is more alarming than any statement he could make.\n🔑 Key Takeaways Jagdeo’s 3-week silence breaks his 5-year pattern of weekly press conferences Three concurrent crises may explain the media blackout: Mohamed family saga, gas-to-energy controversy, and internal party tensions Creates a political vacuum that opposition leader Aubrey Norton is actively filling Could be either a strategic retreat or a sign of deeper internal issues When he returns, expect an explosive press conference addressing accumulated questions THE PATTERN BREAKS Since assuming the role of Vice President in August 2020, Jagdeo has held 147 press conferences—averaging one every 12 days. His Wednesday afternoon briefings became so predictable that journalists cleared their calendars, opposition politicians prepared responses before he even spoke, and ordinary Guyanese tuned in for what many called “the real news of the week.”\nBut on December 22, 2025, that pattern broke.\nThe first missed briefing coincided with the Christmas holidays—understandable, expected even. But then January 8 passed. Then January 15. Now, as we approach the end of January 2026, the silence continues.\nWHAT CHANGED? Multiple sources within the PPP/C, speaking on condition of anonymity, point to three concurrent crises that may explain the media blackout.\nThe Mohamed Family Extradition Saga: The ongoing legal battle involving the Mohamed family has created an uncomfortable spotlight. Every question about the case risks opening doors the administration would prefer remain closed.\nThe Gas-to-Energy Cost Controversy: Recent editorials questioning the gas-to-energy project’s economics compared to solar alternatives have hit a nerve. The project lacks the transparent cost breakdown typically demanded by Jagdeo himself.\nInternal Party Tensions: Less publicly visible but potentially more significant are reported tensions within the PPP/C regarding succession planning and the 2025 local government elections performance.\nTHE COST OF SILENCE Jagdeo’s absence from the media landscape has created a vacuum. Opposition leader Aubrey Norton has held three press conferences in the past two weeks. Social media speculation has filled the void, with theories ranging from illness to political maneuvering to preparation for early elections.\nA STRATEGIC RETREAT? Some analysts suggest the silence might be calculated rather than circumstantial. Without Jagdeo’s controversial statements drawing fire, government accomplishments received more sustained coverage.\n“Sometimes the best communication strategy is to not communicate,” one communications advisor suggested. “Let your opponents punch at shadows.”\nCONCLUSION Three weeks of silence from a man known for never shutting up. Is it strategy? Crisis management? Health concerns? Internal party maneuvering?\nThe answer likely involves elements of all these factors. What’s certain is this: When Jagdeo does return to the podium—and he will—he’ll have months of questions waiting.\nUntil then, we wait. And in that waiting, we learn something important about power in Guyana: Sometimes silence speaks louder than the most carefully crafted statement.\nShare This Article Tweet Share LinkedIn Email 📚 You Might Also Like 🇬🇾 Saturday Brief: Opposition Leader Rips Budget, Secret Extradition Revealed, and Linden Gets a Stadium Opposition Leader Mohamed delivers maiden budget speech and it’s a SCORCHER, a secret US extradition request …\nFeb 7, 2026 Read more → 🌴 Caribbean Brief: Trinidad Carnival EXPLODES, Barbados Election in 4 Days, Jamaica IMF Rescue, and Windies Open T20 Campaign Trinidad Carnival kicks off TODAY, Barbados heads to polls February 11, Jamaica takes $415M IMF emergency loan, West …\nFeb 7, 2026 Read more → 🎬 YouTube Scripts — Saturday, February 7, 2026 60-second and 4-minute HeyGen-ready scripts covering the Opposition Leader’s budget attack, secret extradition, …\nFeb 7, 2026 Read more → 🎯 Bounty Board — Saturday, February 7, 2026 Community events, deadlines, and happenings across Guyana!
