Not even DoorDash is that efficient.\nWhat Happened: Trump sent the boys to Venezuela like it was a Black Friday sale at Courts. Operation resulted in Nicolás Maduro getting the express trip to New York he DEFINITELY didn\u0026rsquo;t book on Travelocity.\n🗣️ WHAT THE PAPERS SAID:\n📰 Stabroek News: \"We must consider the geopolitical implications...\"\n📰 Kaieteur News: \"MADURO GRABBED! WE BEEN TELLING Y'ALL!\"\n📰 Chronicle: \"President Ali Says Things. Government Does Stuff. Everything Fine.\"\n📰 Guyana Times: \"Anyway, here's a story about motorsports and a beauty pageant.\"\nGuyana\u0026rsquo;s Response: President Ali is doing that Caribbean thing where you\u0026rsquo;re simultaneously thrilled, terrified, and trying not to laugh. He commended Trump which is like thanking the bouncer for removing your drunk ex from the party.\nReal Talk: Guyana just watched its annoying neighbor get arrested on COPS: International Edition. Live. In real time. While the whole Caribbean group chat was going absolutely wild.\nThe Awkward Part: Now Guyana has to pretend they\u0026rsquo;re not THRILLED about this. Because diplomacy. And international relations. And the fact that they share a border with a country that just got regime-changed via air strike.\n💰 THE MOHAMEDS: AMERICA\u0026rsquo;S MOST WANTED ⚖️ THE MOHAMED LEGAL SAGA TRACKER ⚖️\nLegal Strategies Used: 80%\rCourts Appealed To: 🏛️🏛️🏛️ (and counting)\nFlorida's Response: *uses full name*\nThis father-son duo is having the kind of week that makes you reconsider all your life choices.\nThe Situation: The Mohameds are fighting extradition to Florida harder than your auntie fights for the last piece of black cake at Christmas.

At this point, Kaieteur News could publish a Mohameds encyclopedia.\nThe Pattern: Court says yes, Lawyers say no, Appeal filed, Repeat. They\u0026rsquo;re currently on loop 4.\nFlorida\u0026rsquo;s Patience Level: Approaching zero. The US Attorney\u0026rsquo;s office has started sending strongly worded letters, which in legal terms is like your mom using your full name.\n🛣️ HEROES HIGHWAY: A LOVE STORY GONE WRONG ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE SPEED-RUN CHALLENGE ⚠️\nBuilt:December 2023 (concrete)\rLasted:13 MONTHS\rExpected Lifespan:20-30 years\rAchievement:World Record Failure\rDecember 2023: Government unveils shiny new concrete highway\nJanuary 2025: Ministry announces asphalt overlay project\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Do The Math: That\u0026rsquo;s 13 months. The highway lasted about as long as a New Year\u0026rsquo;s resolution.\nTranslation: They built a highway with concrete. Premium concrete. It lasted barely over a year. Now they want to cover it with asphalt.\n📋 HOW INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan → Build → Maintain → Use for decades ✓\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) → Build → Celebrate → Break → Act surprised → Announce solutions → Repeat 🔄\nThis is like:\nBuying a Tesla and gluing a bicycle on top Ordering premium steak and covering it with ketchup Building a mansion and putting up wallpaper to hide the cracks Stabroek News (Being Polite): \u0026ldquo;Questions have been raised about whether sound decisions are being made\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nUs (Not Being Polite): Y\u0026rsquo;ALL BUILT A HIGHWAY WRONG.\nWhat Actually Happened: Someone made a decision. That decision was wrong. That wrongness cost millions. Now another decision will cost more millions to fix the first wrong decision.\nEngineering 101: Concrete highways should last 20-30 years. Heroes Highway speedran that timeline like it was going for a world record.\n📱 DIGITAL SCHOOL: WHEN ZOOM FINALLY CAME TO GUYANA 🎓 DIGITAL SCHOOL SUCCESS METRICS 🎓\n✓ Students logged into Zoom\r✓ Internet didn't crash\r✓ Teachers troubleshot for 45 minutes\r✓ Taught for 10 minutes\r→ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!\rThe Ministry of Education is THRILLED to announce that students successfully\u0026hellip; logged into Zoom.\nLet That Sink In: The achievement isn\u0026rsquo;t the lesson. The achievement isn\u0026rsquo;t the teaching. The achievement is that THE INTERNET DIDN\u0026rsquo;T CRASH.\nParticipating Schools: Dora Secondary, St. Cuthbert\u0026rsquo;s Secondary, Kwakwani Secondary, Linden Foundation Secondary, Anna Regina Secondary.\n🏆 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED:\nGuyana Internet Works For 20 Minutes!\nParent\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;So my data plan is now a school supply?\u0026rdquo;\nTeacher\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;I spent 45 minutes troubleshooting connectivity and 10 minutes teaching.\u0026rdquo;\nGovernment\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION!
