**Valentine's Day across the Caribbean: Mia Mottley is in love with winning, the US Navy is in love with shooting boats, and Trinidad's PM is about to sweet-talk an energy conference. Let's go.**

## 🇧🇧 MIA MOTTLEY SWEEPS BARBADOS — AGAIN

Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley has won every single seat in Parliament — for the third consecutive election. She is now only the second Caribbean leader in history to achieve a 30-0 sweep three times, joining former Grenada PM Dr. Keith Mitchell.

The Barbados Labour Party didn't just win. They obliterated. The opposition didn't lose seats — they lost the concept of seats. At this point the opposition benches in Barbados Parliament are decorative furniture. Mottley continues to be the most dominant political force in the Caribbean, and it's not close.

## 🚢 US MILITARY SINKS ANOTHER BOAT IN THE CARIBBEAN

The US military attacked a vessel in the Caribbean Sea on February 13, killing three people. The ship was allegedly transporting drugs along known smuggling routes. This is the **fourth such operation in 2026** — and we're only six weeks into the year.

Since September 2025, US forces have destroyed multiple vessels in international waters, killing at least 80 people. The operations are conducted under the Southern Command's counter-narcotics mandate. No US military personnel have been injured in any of the strikes.

The Caribbean Sea is increasingly becoming a military theatre. Senator Peter Welch has expressed alarm at the mobilisation of National Guard troops, warships, and fighter jets to the region. For Caribbean nations caught between drug routes and US firepower, the question isn't academic — it's existential.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD PM TO ADDRESS CARIBBEAN ENERGY WEEK

Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister will address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 as the twin-island nation positions itself at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge. T&T remains the region's energy anchor, and with Guyana and Suriname's oil booms reshaping the basin, Trinidad is working to stay relevant in a neighbourhood that suddenly got a lot richer.

## 🇹🇼 TAIWAN DONATES US$3M TO ST. VINCENT

Taiwan has donated US$3 million to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for social relief programmes. Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with a handful of Caribbean nations and uses strategic aid to maintain those ties. China, watching from across the strait, takes notes.

## 🇻🇪 CARIBBEAN AIRSPACE STILL FEELING THE SQUEEZE

The aftershocks of the US military operation in Venezuela continue to ripple through Caribbean aviation. While the initial FAA no-fly zone has expired, advisory NOTAMs remain in effect around multiple Caribbean flight regions including San Juan, Curaçao, and Piarco. Airlines have largely resumed normal operations, but routing adjustments continue to affect flight times and costs across the region.

Venezuelan airspace itself has been effectively closed to passenger planes since late November 2025. For Caribbean travellers, the message is clear: check your flight status before you check your bags.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICAN STUDENTS IN CUBA FACE UNCERTAINTY

The Jamaican government is considering what support it can provide to Jamaican students studying in Cuba, whose education is being affected by the island's ongoing economic crisis. Cuba has historically provided scholarships to Caribbean students, particularly in medicine. But with Cuba's economy in freefall, the question is whether those programmes can survive.

## 🇧🇸 FORMER BAHAMAS POLICE OFFICER TO BE SENTENCED

A former senior police officer in the Bahamas is due to be sentenced on February 25 after being found guilty on 10 counts related to the seizure of 72 kilos of cocaine and 15 kilos of marijuana. When the people catching the drugs ARE the drugs, you know things are complicated.

## 🏏 T20 WORLD CUP UPDATE

The Caribbean's cricketers will be looking to improve on recent performances, but with the squad in rebuilding mode, expectations are tempered.
