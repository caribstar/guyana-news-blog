Stay informed, Guyana!”\n[END CARD: guyanadailybrief.com]\nRUNTIME: 55-60 seconds (~155 words)\nSCRIPT 2: 4-MINUTE VERSION (YouTube Long Form) [TITLE CARD: THE GUYANA BRIEF — FULL BREAKDOWN — Feb 2, 2026]\n[AVATAR ON SCREEN]\n“What’s happening everybody! Welcome to The Guyana Brief for Monday, February 2nd, 2026. Big, big day for Guyana. Let’s get into it.\n[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET DEBATE]\nFirst up — Budget 2026 debate officially opens today in the National Assembly. This is a one point five five eight TRILLION dollar budget — a 307% increase from 2021. Finance Minister Ashni Singh says it’s all about putting people first.\nThe highlights? 183 billion for education, including the Guyana Digital School with 22,000 students already signed up. 161 billion for healthcare — we’re training 162 specialist doctors and over 5,000 nurses. 159 billion for housing, with 40,000 new homes promised. And every adult 18 and over getting that $100,000 cash grant.\nNow, the opposition is calling this reckless spending. The government says it’s nation-building. Expect fireworks in the Assembly today — both sides have a LOT to say.\n[SEGMENT 2: MOHAMEDS RULING]\nAlso happening TODAY — the Acting Chief Justice is expected to rule on the Mohameds extradition case. Gold traders Azruddin and Nazar Mohamed are challenging the entire extradition process, saying the Home Affairs Minister’s decision was unlawful and biased.\nRemember, Azruddin Mohamed is the elected Leader of the Opposition. The government has been accused of delaying Parliament sittings hoping an extradition order comes through first. The prosecution even tried to rush the hearing to an earlier date. Whatever the ruling is today, it’s going to have massive political implications.\n[SEGMENT 3: DEVELOPMENT NEWS]\nOn the development front — the Plaza Court Hotel opened on Main Street Georgetown this weekend. Sixty rooms, modern design, international standards. President Ali was at the ribbon cutting. Guyana hit 453,000 visitors last year, so we need every hotel room we can get.\nPlus, the government is investing over 120 million dollars in Mashramani 2026 — the biggest Mash investment ever. It’s Guyana’s 60th Independence anniversary, so expect costumes, music, and celebrations like never before.\nThe UK partnership also got stronger — Deputy PM David Lammy came to Georgetown and signed onto the Global Biodiversity Alliance. The world is watching Guyana, and they’re impressed.\n[SEGMENT 4: CARIBBEAN ROUNDUP]\nQuick Caribbean roundup! Barbados goes to the polls on February 11 — that’s nine days away. PM Mia Mottley is going for a THIRD consecutive term. The DLP hasn’t won a single seat in two elections. Can they break the streak? Most analysts say no.\nIn Trinidad, there’s massive outrage after CCTV footage showed police shooting a man who appeared to have his hands in the air. The Law Association is questioning the police commissioner’s decision not to suspend the officers. This is the fourth police killing in Trinidad for 2026.\nAnd cricket fans — West Indies vs Afghanistan T20 series starts in Dubai as warmup for the T20 World Cup on February 7th!\n[CLOSING]\nThat’s your Monday brief, Guyana! Budget debate, court rulings, new hotels, and Mash season. Subscribe and share with your people — let’s keep everybody informed.\nUntil next time — one Guyana, one love! Stay blessed!”\n[END CARD: guyanadailybrief.com — Subscribe]\nRUNTIME: 3:45 - 4:00 (~620 words)\nPRODUCTION NOTES FOR HEYGEN Avatar Style: Professional but approachable, Caribbean-accented English\nBackground: News desk or modern studio setting\nText Overlays Needed:\n“$1.558 TRILLION” for budget segment “Mohameds Ruling TODAY” for court segment “Plaza Court Hotel — 60 Rooms” for development segment “Barbados Election — Feb 11” for Caribbean segment Key names: Ali, Singh, Mohamed, Mottley Music: Upbeat Caribbean instrumental (royalty-free)\nTransitions: Quick cuts between segments\nThumbnail Suggestions:\n60-second: “BUDGET + COURT RULING — SAME DAY!” with split screen 4-minute: “GUYANA’S BIGGEST MONDAY” with Parliament building graphic ","wordCount":"832","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-02-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-02-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-02-02-youtube-scripts/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">YouTube Scripts — Monday, February 2, 2026</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-02-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 2, 2026</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=youtube-scripts--monday-february-2-2026>YOUTUBE SCRIPTS — MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2026<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#youtube-scripts--monday-february-2-2026>#</a></h1><hr><h1 id=script-1-60-second-version-youtube-shorts--tiktok>SCRIPT 1: 60-SECOND VERSION (YouTube Shorts / TikTok)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#script-1-60-second-version-youtube-shorts--tiktok>#</a></h1><hr><p><strong>[TITLE CARD: THE GUYANA BRIEF — Feb 2, 2026]</strong></p><p><strong>[AVATAR ON SCREEN]</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Guyana!
