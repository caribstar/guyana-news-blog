## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: $415 Million IMF Bailout — Because Even Paradise Needs Cash

The IMF Executive Board has approved Jamaica's request for **US$415 million** in emergency financial assistance.

**Why?** To meet "urgent balance-of-payments needs."

**Translation:** The books looking rough and they need help quick.

Jamaica — land of reggae, jerk chicken, and apparently, fiscal emergencies. But don't worry, the beaches still beautiful and the resorts still full. The tourists don't need to know about the balance sheet.

**Meanwhile:** Jamaica Tourist Board projecting 10% growth in stayover arrivals for 2025. So the country broke but the hotels booked. Economics is wild.

**What This Means:**
- Longer connection times through the region
- More complex routing for Caribbean travel
- Higher fares on certain routes (competition dropping)
- Jamaica-Florida routes already cancelled in November 2025

Caribbean Airlines struggling with "financial sustainability." Passengers with confirmed reservations are getting full refunds.

**The Upside:** Avelo Airlines expanding into Caribbean markets from New Orleans, Tampa, and Providence. Budget travel options increasing even as the flagship carrier retreats.
