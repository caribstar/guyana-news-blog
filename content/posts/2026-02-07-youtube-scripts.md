Happy Saturday, Guyana!

Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed delivered his maiden budget speech and went ALL IN — attacking the trillion-dollar budget for ignoring public servants, failing the fishing industry, and having weak oil revenue oversight.

Meanwhile, a SECRET US extradition request from November was revealed in court, and three senior government ministers are refusing to comment.

Big day for Linden — the brand new Bayroc National Stadium opens tonight with athletics, football, and a concert. One of five stadiums coming online this year.

President Ali visited mining communities promising land, trucks, bank accounts, and reduced duties on vehicles — but miners must declare their gold legally.

The ICJ announced oral hearings on the Guyana-Venezuela border case start May 4th. HUGE.

And the Windies open their T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland in Kolkata today at five-thirty AM!

That's your Saturday update. Stay informed, Guyana!

**TITLE: Saturday Guyana Roundup — Budget Fireworks, Secret Extradition, Stadium Opening & Cricket**

---

Good morning, Guyana! Welcome to your Saturday news roundup, and what a week it's been. Let's break it all down.

**THE BIG STORY: Opposition Leader's Maiden Budget Speech**

Newly elected Leader of the Opposition Azruddin Mohamed delivered his first-ever budget debate speech Friday evening, and he did NOT hold back. He called the one-point-five-five-eight TRILLION dollar budget a smokescreen that masks weak oversight of oil revenues, worsening living conditions, and persistent power outages.

His strongest hit? Pointing out that nearly seventy thousand public servants received NO salary increase in the biggest budget in Guyana's history. He also flagged the declining birth rate, saying women simply cannot afford to have children under current economic conditions.

The government side pushed back hard. Minister Gail Teixeira defended the PPP's record, dismissing what she called the opposition's narrow assessment of poverty and growth indicators. Chief Investment Officer Peter Ramsaroop praised President Ali's leadership, calling him the visionary behind Guyana's transformation.

Both sides have valid points. But the numbers don't lie — it IS the biggest budget ever, and public servants DID get left out.

**SECRET EXTRADITION REVEALED**

In a dramatic court moment, the Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary confirmed that the United States sent ANOTHER extradition request in November twenty-twenty-five — for a different person entirely. When journalists asked the Prime Minister, the Home Affairs Minister, and the Attorney General for details, all three refused to comment.

Mohamed himself demanded transparency during his speech, asking why the government is hiding this information. It's a fair question. If the government has nothing to hide, why the silence?

**BAYROC STADIUM OPENS TODAY**

On a more positive note, Linden celebrates TODAY with the grand opening of the Bayroc National Stadium. This is a genuine achievement — a synthetic track, floodlights, professional facilities, and international certification goals. The opening ceremony includes athletics, a Georgetown versus Linden football match, and a Pre-Mashramani concert.

This is one of five regional stadiums under construction, all expected to be operational this year. Credit to the government for investing in sporting infrastructure outside Georgetown. Linden deserves this.

**ALI MEETS MINERS**

President Ali spent Friday in Region Seven — Puruni and Bartica — meeting small-scale miners. He announced a sweeping support package including land allocations for miner consortiums, banks setting up directly in mining communities, and major duty reductions on vehicles and ATVs.

The catch? Miners must declare ALL gold through legal channels. The government has been cracking down on illegal mining, with fifty-three arrests and convictions in January alone.

The mining sector is critical to Guyana's economy beyond oil, and formalising it is long overdue. Whether the government follows through on these promises — equally to ALL miners — remains to be seen.

**ICJ BORDER CASE**

Attorney General Nandlall announced that oral hearings in the Guyana-Venezuela border case will begin on May fourth at the International Court of Justice. This is arguably the most important legal proceeding in Guyana's history. Every citizen should be paying attention.

**CRICKET TIME!**

And finally — the T20 World Cup starts TODAY! West Indies take on Scotland at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, at five-thirty AM Guyana time. Captain Shai Hope says the team is focused on making Caribbean fans proud. Let's hope they deliver.

**ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN**

Trinidad Carnival kicks off today. Barbados heads to elections on February eleventh. Jamaica just took a four-hundred-fifteen-million-dollar IMF emergency loan. And the US is tightening visa requirements for Caribbean nationals.

That's your Saturday roundup, Guyana. Big day ahead — stadium opening, cricket, and carnival vibes across the region. Stay informed, stay engaged, and as always — we read the news so you can laugh and cry.

Have a great weekend!
