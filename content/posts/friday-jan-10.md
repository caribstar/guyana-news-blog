## 🤝 BREAKING: GUYANA VOLUNTEERS AS AMERICA'S STORAGE UNIT

In the wildest plot twist since the 2020 elections, Guyana is in productive discussions with the United States about accepting third country nationals.

**Let That Sink In:** America wants to deport people from OTHER countries to Guyana. Not Americans. Not even people who've ever BEEN to Guyana. Just random third-country nationals that America doesn't want.

**The Pitch:** "Hey Guyana, you know those people from Country X that we don't want? Yeah, how about YOU take them?"  
**Guyana's Response:** "Sure! What could possibly go wrong?"

**Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud:** "Guyana and the USA have been in productive discussions on a framework of understanding which is consistent with our national priorities..."  
**Translation:** "We said yes but we're using big words to make it sound strategic."

**What This Actually Means:**
- Guyana gets people it didn't deport
- From countries Guyana has no relationship with
- Who don't speak Guyanese English
- And probably don't want to be here

**It's Like:** Your friend asking "Can I store some stuff at your place?" and showing up with someone ELSE's furniture from THEIR friend's house that they're throwing out.

**The Opposition Is BIG MAD:**

**WIN:** "NO BACKROOM DEALS! We demand transparency!"  
**Forward Guyana:** "Sovereignty belongs to the PEOPLE!"  
**The Government:** "But you guys made backroom deals when YOU were in power?"  
**Everyone:** *conveniently forgets*

**Kaieteur News Coverage:** FULL CAPS LOCK MODE. Multiple editorials. "THE PEOPLE MUST KNOW!" They wrote more about this than the actual government did.

**Stabroek News:** *adjusts intellectual glasses* "Questions have been raised about the constitutional implications and long-term socioeconomic ramifications of such bilateral arrangements..."

**Chronicle:** "PRESIDENT ALI PRAISED BY U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO AS REGIONAL SECURITY PARTNER!" That's the headline. That's the whole story.

**Guyana Times:** "In other news, ten delegates are ready for the Miss East Bank Demerara pageant!"

**Meanwhile, Secretary Rubio:** Commending Ali for his leadership as a regional security partner. Which is diplomat-speak for "thanks for saying yes to our weird request."

**The Real Story:** Guyana just watched Trump literally invade Venezuela, kidnap Maduro, and say "we're keeping the oil." And Guyana's response was "yes, we'd LOVE to be more involved with these people."

**Bold Strategy:** Let's see how it plays out.

## 💰 THE MOHAMEDS: SEASON 2, EPISODE 47

The father-son business duo that keeps on giving us headlines has filed YET ANOTHER appeal.

**This Week's Move:** Appeal to the Full Court against Acting Chief Justice Navindra Singh's ruling.

**For Those Keeping Score:**
- Original extradition request: ✓
- Lawyer says they're not going anywhere: ✓
- Court says yes they are: ✓
- Appeal filed: ✓
- Another appeal filed: ✓
- Another court: ✓
- We are here: More appeals

**Their Legal Strategy:** If at first you don't succeed, appeal, appeal again.

**The Magistrate's Patience:** Has left the building. Left the city. Possibly left the country.

**Defence Team's Confidence Level:** "VERY CONFIDENT this will be dismissed!"

**Everyone Else:** "You said that last time. And the time before that."

**What They're Accused Of:** Multiple charges we're not allowed to discuss because libel laws exist.

**What Kaieteur News Has Written:** Approximately 4,000 articles. Give or take. They've turned the Mohamed saga into a daily soap opera. Days of Our Extraditions.

**Best Kaieteur Headline:** "The Mohameds are not going anywhere" followed immediately by another story about their latest court appearance about them potentially going somewhere.

**Chronicle's Mohameds Coverage:** *whispers* "It's extremely laughable and elevated irony..." *quickly pivots to infrastructure projects*

**Guyana Times:** "DID SOMEONE SAY BEAUTY PAGEANT?"

**Real Talk:** These lawyers are burning through legal strategies like Guyana burns through infrastructure budgets. At this rate, they'll be appealing to the UN, the Pope, and Judge Judy.

## 🌉 HIGH STREET BRIDGE JOINS THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL OF SHAME

BREAKING: The High Street Bridge has officially given up on life.

**The Problem:** The section between Lamaha and Cowan Streets is cracked and sinking.

**The Solution:** Weight limit of 10 tonnes. Which means heavy trucks can't use it. Which means the bridge designed for traffic can't handle traffic.

**This Is The Same Country That:**
- Built Heroes Highway with concrete in December 2023
- Announced asphalt overlay in January 2025 (13 months later)
- Acts shocked every time something breaks

**The Ministry's Statement:** "A weight restriction of 10 tons will be imposed with immediate effect."

**What They Didn't Say:**
- How long it's been cracked
- When they noticed
- If anyone's actually going to fix it
- How many OTHER bridges are secretly cracking

**Stabroek News:** "Questions again about whether sound decisions are being made on infrastructural projects."

**Us:** QUESTIONS? We're past questions! We're at ANSWERS! And the answer is NO!

**How Infrastructure Works Elsewhere:**
1. Plan
2. Build
3. Maintain
4. Use for decades

**How Infrastructure Works in Guyana:**
1. Plan (maybe)
2. Build with questionable materials
3. Ribbon-cutting ceremony
4. Celebrate
5. Watch it fall apart within the year
6. Act surprised
7. Announce solutions
8. Repeat

**Engineering Excellence:** At this rate, Guyana's infrastructure is teaching civil engineering students exactly what NOT to do.

## 🏫 18 SCHOOLS TO BE COMMISSIONED

The government is commissioning 18 new schools by end of Q1 2026!

**The Schools:** Fly Hill Nursery, Cracrana Primary, Kwebana Secondary, and 15 others we're definitely going to remember.

**Chronicle's Energy:** "18 NEW SCHOOLS!" *throws confetti* "PROGRESS! DEVELOPMENT!"

**Stabroek News:** *skeptical eyebrow raise* "Completion timelines and resource allocation remain unclear..."

**Questions Nobody's Asking:**
- When did construction actually START?
- Do they have teachers?
- Do they have desks?
- Do they have Wi-Fi that works?

**The Pattern:**
- Year 1: Announce schools
- Year 2: Construction ongoing
- Year 3: Nearing completion
- Year 4: Will be commissioned soon
- Year 5 (Election Year): LOOK! 18 SCHOOLS!

**Meanwhile, The Digital School:** Successfully held its first lesson where students logged into Zoom without the internet dying!

**The Achievement:** Not the education. Not the lesson quality. Just that the internet worked.

## 📊 GRA DISCOVERS INTERNAL CONSPIRACY

The Guyana Revenue Authority found a coordinated internal conspiracy involving several employees.

**What That Means:** People at the tax-collecting agency were allegedly helping people NOT pay taxes.

**The Irony:** MAXIMUM. The fox was guarding the henhouse. And eating the chickens. And selling the eggs. And subletting the coop.

**How Bad Is It:** Bad enough that GRA called it coordinated and internal which means this wasn't one person. This was a TEAM EFFORT.

**Government Response:** "We're shocked and appalled!"  
**Everyone Else:** "Really? You're SHOCKED? In Guyana?"

## 🎯 YOUR DAILY RECAP

**What We Learned:**
1. Guyana accepting other people's deportees (bold)
2. The Mohameds found another court (impressive)
3. Bridges are temporary infrastructure (apparently)
4. 18 schools are ready (we'll see)
5. Working internet equals national achievement
6. Tax collectors can't be trusted (who knew?)

**Tomorrow's Forecast:**
- 100% chance of Mohamed updates
- 90% chance of infrastructure excuses
- 80% chance of Venezuela confusion
- 60% chance your bridge is cracking
- 50% chance your internet works
