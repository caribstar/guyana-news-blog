## Eh-eh! All Dis Drama Over Who Gon Lead De Losing Side?

Listen, me reading dis Brief dis morning and me nearly spit out me chai.

All dis NOISE about who gon be Opposition Leader? Bai, dem LOST de election! De people SPOKE! Now dem fighting over who gon be CAPTAIN of de TITANIC after it done hit de iceberg!

De Brief talking bout "global embarrassment" if Azruddin Mohamed get elect. Lemme tell you something — de REAL embarrassment is dat de opposition couldn't find ANYBODY ELSE in de whole country to represent dem! 

And now rights groups telling Opposition MPs to "place country above faction"? WHERE WAS DIS ENERGY when de Coalition was in power destroying GuySuCo and firing thousands of sugar workers at CHRISTMAS TIME?! 

*sips chai aggressively*

## De REAL News Dem Not Focusing On

While everybody obsessing over dis Opposition Leader drama, look what ACTUALLY happening in Guyana:

**Airlines cutting fares by 7%!** Roraima, Trans Guyana, Jags — all of dem answering President Ali call. When last you see de private sector RESPOND to government so fast? Dat is LEADERSHIP. Dat is RESPECT.

**Women's Chamber building REAL infrastructure!** Training women entrepreneurs, tackling care work gaps, addressing gender violence. DIS is development. Not who gon sit in de Opposition chair and complain!

**Tourism expanding!** Cruise ships on de Demerara River! 46 rooms! Gym! Guyana becoming a DESTINATION while de opposition fighting over who gon lose next election!

**Chikungunya alert!** De Health Ministry IMMEDIATELY put hospitals on alert when Suriname report cases. DAT is proactive governance! Not waiting for people to get sick first!

## Let Me Break Down De Opposition Leader Ting

De Brief acting like dis is some big constitutional crisis. Let me explain for dem who forget:

1. **WIN party won de most opposition seats.** Dat is DEMOCRACY.
2. **Dem leader is Azruddin Mohamed.** Also DEMOCRACY.
3. **De Speaker schedule de vote.** CONSTITUTIONAL.
4. **Monday dem gon vote.** END OF STORY.

All dis hand-wringing about US charges and sanctions — bai, de man innocent until proven guilty! Dis is GUYANA, not America! We have we OWN court system!

And let we be honest — if de PPP had a businessman accused of tax issues, de same papers would be calling it "political persecution" and "witch hunt." De Chronicle right to point out de hypocrisy!

## Speaking of De Newspapers

De Brief mention de "newspaper wars" and me have to laugh. 

Kaieteur News asking if Guyana is a "vassal state" — bai, we just had de US BOMB Venezuela and President Ali calmly activated security, talked to ExxonMobil, coordinated with CARICOM. DAT LOOK LIKE A VASSAL TO YOU?! 

Dat look like a LEADER managing a CRISIS while de Opposition couldn't even manage to find a candidate without legal troubles!

And Stabroek News with dem paywall and dem "why de Speaker take so long" questions — maybe because de Speaker was being RESPONSIBLE? Maybe because he was hoping de courts would sort out de mess before Parliament? But NO, dat can't be de reason! Must be CONSPIRACY!

*mutters in Guyanese*

## What De Diaspora REALLY Thinking

Me talk to me friends here in Queens. You know what dem saying?

"Ramesh, look how Guyana DEVELOPING! Look de new roads! Look de hospital equipment! Look de schools! Look de Gas-to-Energy project!"

NOBODY asking "who gon be Opposition Leader?" Nobody CARE! Because de GOVERNMENT working! De PPP DELIVERING!

De Opposition could elect a COCONUT as Leader and it wouldn't change de fact dat Guyana GDP growing, foreign investment pouring in, and de country TRANSFORMING!

---

## Me Final Word

Monday gon come. Dem gon vote. Somebody gon be Opposition Leader. And den Tuesday gon come, and President Ali still gon be President, and de government still gon be building roads, and de opposition still gon be complaining from de sidelines.

Dis is how DEMOCRACY work. De people choose. De winners govern. De losers... well, dem get to choose who gon lead dem losing.

So save yuh stress! Drink yuh tea! Watch de development continue!

And remember — all dem people writing columns about "constitutional crisis" was de SAME people who tried to rig de 2020 election. Short memory? Me think so!

**LONG LIVE GUYANA!** 🇬🇾
