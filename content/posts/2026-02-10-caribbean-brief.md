## 🗳️ Barbados: Election Eve

**Barbados goes to the polls TOMORROW** (Wednesday, February 11). Schools will be closed to facilitate voting. PM Mia Mottley's Barbados Labour Party faces what observers say is the most competitive election in years.

The Commonwealth has deployed election observers. Meanwhile, PM Mottley made headlines by slamming opposition figure Ralph Thorne's interview with a Trinidad media outlet, suggesting external interference. Trinidad PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar has denied that her UNC party is trying to influence the Barbados result.

Caribbean politics: where your neighbour's newspaper interview becomes a diplomatic incident.

Early voting is already underway.

## 🛢️ Trinidad: Energy Week and Airspace Drama

Trinidad PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar will address **Caribbean Energy Week 2026** amid what's being described as a "multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge." T&T continues positioning itself as the region's energy hub.

Meanwhile, Defence Minister Wayne Sturge has had to publicly deny social media claims that Trinidad's airspace has been restricted. The denials come amid broader tensions over US military operations in the Caribbean Sea.

Barbados Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds expressed concerns about recent US military strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, saying the actions "may have bypassed due process." Senator Jack Reed in Washington also condemned the strikes.

The Caribbean is caught between American military assertiveness and the need to maintain sovereign waters. Nobody asked for this.

## 🎵 Jamaica: Reggae Loses Another Legend

**Stephen "Cat" Coore**, co-founder of the legendary reggae band **Third World**, died suddenly on Sunday at age 69. He was the third member of the band to pass since its formation. Culture Minister Olivia Grange said his legacy "will live on."

This comes just weeks after the passing of **Sly Dunbar**, the iconic drummer of Sly and Robbie. Jamaica's music world is in mourning.

In other Jamaica news, the Ministry of Entertainment says it raised an estimated **J$200 million** from the "I Love Jamaica" concert series, supporting recovery from Hurricane Melissa.

And two senior government employees were arrested at Sangster International Airport after police seized **J$5 million worth of cocaine**. Because apparently even civil servants have side hustles.

## 🏏 T20 World Cup Update

West Indies opened their campaign with a win over Scotland! The tournament is underway in India and Sri Lanka. Guyanese players Sherfane Rutherford and Gudakesh Motie were among the standouts.

However, there's been a logistical hiccup — explosive batsman **Shimron Hetmyer is reportedly stranded** due to travel issues and hasn't yet joined the squad. Windies management working to sort it. Classic Caribbean cricket administration.

## 🌊 Tourism Decline Continues

Data from the US shows Caribbean tourism arrivals dropping across the board for 2025. Haiti took the worst hit (-36%), but Bahamas (-3.5%), Jamaica (-10.9%), Barbados (-3.3%), and Trinidad (-5.5%) all declined. The region is adapting strategies but the competition from emerging destinations is real.

Adding to headaches: new US visa restrictions targeting "birth tourism" will affect nationals from Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, Antigua, Dominica, and Grenada in 2026. Stricter interviews, deeper scrutiny, longer processing times.

**St. Vincent** received a US$3 million donation from Taiwan for social relief programs.

**Dominican Republic** is opening a "tourism war" with Mexico, competing aggressively for beach-holiday market share.

**Haiti** remains in crisis, with a US judicial ruling on Temporary Protected Status highlighting the deepening humanitarian situation.
