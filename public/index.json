[{"content":"Good morning, Guyana! ☕\nWelcome to another week of organized chaos, bureaucratic magic, and statistical creativity.\nIf you thought the weekend would bring a break—cute. You must be new here.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s Menu: GuySuCo gets scolded (again), The Mohameds perfect staying put, crime stats get creative, and someone learned why we don\u0026rsquo;t complain about bribery here.\n📊 THE NUMBERS Mohamed Appeal-O-Meter: 47 appeals filed, 0 relocations\nDays Since Opposition Leader Appeared: 71 (consistency!)\nGuySuCo Promises vs Reality Gap: ∞\nCrime down, murders up: Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s statistics\n🏢 GUYSUCO: THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON NOT GIVING President Ali held \u0026ldquo;The Annual Disappointment Summit\u0026rdquo; with GuySuCo over the weekend, expressing \u0026ldquo;strong dissatisfaction\u0026rdquo; with their failure to meet 2025 targets.\nIn other news, water is wet.\n📊 GuySuCo Track Record:\n2023 targets: ❌ Missed (weather!) 2024 targets: ❌ Missed (equipment!) 2025 targets: ❌ Missed (circumstances!) 2026 targets: ❓ nervous laughter Success rate: 0% (but very consistent!)\nThe consequence for missing targets? Another stern meeting. Revolutionary.\nNext time maybe a VERY stern meeting. Or an EXTREMELY stern meeting. The possibilities are endless!\nAt this rate, GuySuCo will hit targets when The Mohameds voluntarily board a plane—which is to say, never.\n⏳ THE MOHAMEDS: PROFESSIONAL STAYERS Their lawyer said they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;NOT going anywhere.\u0026rdquo; Turns out, 100% accurate. Give that man a Nobel Prize in Honesty.\nUpdate: Extradition hearing adjourned to February 5th.\n📅 The Mohamed Calendar™:\nJanuary: File 3 appeals, adjourn hearing\nFebruary: File 4 more appeals, adjourn again\nMarch-December: See January-February, repeat with passion\nStatus: Still here, still filing, still making lawyers wealthy\nDeparture date: When GuySuCo meets targets (never)\nUS prosecutors asked to \u0026ldquo;bring forward\u0026rdquo; the hearing. Adorable. They must be new.\nIn Guyana\u0026rsquo;s legal system, \u0026ldquo;expedited\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;eventually,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;urgent\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;this decade,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;NOT going anywhere\u0026rdquo; means exactly that.\nWhat happens first:\nVenus orbits the sun (224 days) A sloth finishes a marathon The Mohameds board a plane Spoiler: Venus.\n📉 CRIME STATS: CREATIVE MATHEMATICS The Police Force dropped their 2025 report: Serious crimes down 25.5%! 🎉\nThe fine print: Side effects include increased murders. Do not operate statistics while reading reality.\n📊 The ACTUAL Numbers:\nMurders: UP 11% Road deaths: UP 6% (137 people) \u0026ldquo;Serious crimes\u0026rdquo;: Down 25.5%! 🎉 Formula: Crime is down if you don\u0026rsquo;t count the crimes!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like saying your diet\u0026rsquo;s amazing because you lost 5 pounds—just don\u0026rsquo;t mention the 15 you gained first.\nThings apparently NOT \u0026ldquo;serious crimes\u0026rdquo;:\nMurder (up 11%) Vehicular manslaughter (up 6%) Filing 47 appeals to avoid extradition Things that ARE \u0026ldquo;serious crimes\u0026rdquo;:\nPosting videos about gun licenses (see Stanley Basdeo below) The GPF expects celebration while murders are rising. It\u0026rsquo;s like celebrating the Titanic\u0026rsquo;s dry ballroom while the ship sank.\n🚤 RIP GOLDEN GLOVES: 70 YEARS WASN\u0026rsquo;T ENOUGH After SEVENTY YEARS of service, Golden Gloves speedboat was shut down by the GRA for \u0026ldquo;irregularities.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat existed in 1955:\nGolden Gloves ✅ The Soviet Union ✅ Polio vaccine ✅ What doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore:\nAll of the above ❌ 📊 Survival Guide:\nWhat survives:\n✅ Mohamed legal defense (IMMORTAL) ✅ GuySuCo missing targets (ETERNAL) What doesn\u0026rsquo;t:\n❌ 70-year businesses (paperwork issues) ❌ Heroes Highway (25 months max) ❌ Opposition leadership (missing) Golden Gloves survived:\nIndependence, multiple governments, economic crises, the Cold War, Y2K, the ENTIRE Mohamed saga What killed it? Paperwork irregularities.\nAfter 70 years, NOW is regulation time.\nMeanwhile, The Mohameds have been \u0026ldquo;regularising\u0026rdquo; for years with 47 appeals. Nobody\u0026rsquo;s stopping THEM.\n💰 STANLEY BASDEO: COMPLAINED TOO LOUDLY US businessman Stanley Basdeo posted a video about:\nDifficulty getting gun licenses Bribery in Guyana Government\u0026rsquo;s response: CYBERCRIME CHARGES.\n📊 Legal Response Times:\nCharging video complaint: ⚡ 24 hours\nExtraditing actual criminals: 🐌 847+ days\nFixing bribery he mentioned: 🤔 File not found\nThe crime: Making a video about stuff everyone knows.\nThe punishment: $200,000 bail + surrendered passport.\nFor comparison:\nThe Mohameds: 47 appeals, still have passports Stanley: 1 video, passport confiscated The irony: He complained about bribery and now he\u0026rsquo;s in the legal system where\u0026hellip; well, you get it.\nThings you CAN do:\nFile infinite appeals ✅ Miss targets annually ✅ Things you CANNOT do:\nPost videos about bribery ❌ Lesson: You can file 47 appeals (fine!), but you cannot post one (1) video about systemic issues (CYBERCRIME!).\n📅 THE WEEK AHEAD Monday: Last week\u0026rsquo;s chaos was an aberration. (It wasn\u0026rsquo;t.)\nTuesday: \u0026ldquo;On track\u0026rdquo; update #848. Drinking game optional.\nWednesday: Mohamed appeal #48. Lawyer buys third vacation home.\nThursday: GuySuCo misses micro-target. Blames solar flares.\nFriday: New timeline announced. Immediately obsolete.\nProbability GuySuCo meets target: 0.1%\nProbability Mohameds board plane: Cannot calculate impossibility\n📝 THE BOTTOM LINE Another Monday of delays (sorry, \u0026ldquo;adjustments\u0026rdquo;), projects \u0026ldquo;firmly on track\u0026rdquo; (hopelessly behind), and crime stats that defy mathematics.\nThe pattern:\nWork 70 years? Paperwork violation.\nFile appeals for 2+ years? Carry on!\nMeet targets? What\u0026rsquo;s a target? —GuySuCo\nPost videos? Cybercrime within 24 hours.\nBut hey, at least Costco toilet paper is coming (Feb 5).

According to their lawyer, Sanjeev Datadin, the US wants to extradite them because they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;Indian Guyanese\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;successful businessmen.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Break This Down:\nTheir Argument: America is targeting them because of their ethnicity and success.\nReality: America is targeting them because Florida has an active criminal case against them for money laundering.\nThe Victim Narrative: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve done nothing wrong! We\u0026rsquo;re being persecuted!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Court Record: Multiple appeals, all denied.

At this point, they could publish The Complete Mohamed Saga: Volumes 1-47.\nThe Timeline: Every time a court says no, they find a new reason to appeal. They\u0026rsquo;ve turned extradition into a marathon sport.\n⚡ CONTRACTOR NEARLY KILLS HIMSELF (AND HALF OF GEORGETOWN) ⚠️ CLOSE CALL ALERT ⚠️\nPower Line Voltage: 69,000 volts\nCrane Proximity: Too close\nSafety Protocol Followed: Questionable\nOutcome: Everyone lived (somehow)\nA contractor working on Sheriff Street almost touched a 69,000-volt power line with his crane. Yes, you read that right. Sixty-nine THOUSAND volts.\nFor Context: That\u0026rsquo;s enough electricity to vaporize a person. Instantly. No second chances. No \u0026ldquo;oops, my bad.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Happened:\nContractor lifting materials Crane gets dangerously close to overhead power lines GPL (Guyana Power \u0026amp; Light) technicians notice Emergency shutdown before catastrophe The Scary Part: This wasn\u0026rsquo;t discovered by the contractor. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t caught by site safety. This was caught by GPL technicians who happened to be paying attention.\nTranslation: Someone almost died because basic safety protocols weren\u0026rsquo;t followed. And we only know about it because GPL\u0026rsquo;s people were alert.\n💡 HOW CONSTRUCTION WORKS:\nElsewhere: Plan → Survey site → Identify hazards → Implement safety → Execute\nIn Guyana: Plan (maybe) → Start work → Almost cause disaster → Act surprised → Blame someone else\nThe Questions Nobody\u0026rsquo;s Asking:\nWho approved this project without a proper safety plan? Why were the power lines not clearly marked? What happens to the contractor?

Look at the big picture!\u0026rdquo;\nThe Big Picture: More people were murdered. More people died on the roads. That\u0026rsquo;s the picture.\nThe Breakdown:\nMurders: 11% increase Road deaths: 6% increase Combined: 274 lives lost What Actually Decreased: Robberies, break-ins, larceny. Good! But when MURDER is up double digits, maybe lead with that?\n🎯 ADDRESSING CRIME:\nWhat Works: Community policing, better training, accountability, improved response times\nWhat We Got: \"Crime is down!\" (when it's actually up in the categories that matter most)\n🎬 TOURISM GUYANA: STILL STRUGGLING The vlogger incidents continue! Two separate incidents, two different responses, same underlying problem.\nIncident #1: French vlogger slapped by vendor. Court case pending.\nIncident #2: British vlogger films rough areas, calls Guyana \u0026ldquo;Third World.\u0026rdquo; Chronicle responds by attacking him personally instead of addressing the issues he filmed.\nThe Pattern: When tourists show reality, we attack the tourists instead of fixing the reality.\n🏗️ THE 40,000 HOUSES PROMISE 🏠 HOUSING MATH CHECK:\nPromise: 40,000 houses by 2028\nTime Remaining: ~3 years\nRequired Pace: 37 houses PER DAY\nCurrent Reality: Ha. Haha. HAHAHAHA.\nVice President Bharrat Jagdeo reminded everyone of the government\u0026rsquo;s promise to deliver 40,000 houses by 2028.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Do The Math:\n40,000 houses ÷ 3 years = 13,333 houses/year 13,333 houses ÷ 365 days = 36.5 houses PER DAY For Perspective: That\u0026rsquo;s completing a house every 39 minutes. For three years straight. Without breaks.\nCurrent Status: They\u0026rsquo;ve allocated land. Land allocation ≠ built houses.\n💡 THE ELECTRICITY PROMISE (REMEMBER THAT?) Remember when they promised \u0026ldquo;no more blackouts\u0026rdquo; by end of 2024? It\u0026rsquo;s 2026. Still waiting.\nThe Pattern:\nMake bold promise Miss deadline Announce new timeline Repeat 🤷 THE OPPOSITION: STILL MISSING Where is the opposition? Seriously, where are they? The Mohamed case has Parliament frozen. No sessions, no debates, no oversight.\nDemocracy Requires: Active opposition holding government accountable\nWhat We Have: Silence\n🏆 ACTUAL GOOD NEWS: AISHALTON AIRSTRIP Finally, some genuinely good news! The Aishalton airstrip project is actually progressing well. On time, on budget, serving the community.\nProof: Infrastructure projects CAN work when properly managed.\n🏆 YOUR SATURDAY RECAP 📚 WHAT WE LEARNED:\nThe Mohameds are now victims (apparently) 69,000 volts is not a suggestion Murder is up, but \"crime is down\" Tourists with cameras remain public enemy #1 40,000 houses = 37/day (good luck) The electricity promise aged poorly The opposition is on permanent vacation Aishalton proves we CAN do things right Sunday: Rest.
