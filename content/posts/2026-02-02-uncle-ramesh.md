summary: "Uncle Ramesh reads the papers independently and finds plenty to celebrate: Budget 2026's massive investments, a fancy new Georgetown hotel, record tourism numbers, and the UK rolling out the red carpet for Guyana. The opposition? Still complaining."

Alright, alright. Monday morning and me reading the Chronicle with me coffee, and boy oh boy, THIS is the Guyana I been telling all you doubters about.

## BUDGET 2026: A MASTERCLASS IN NATION-BUILDING

You see this budget? **$1.558 TRILLION.** That is a 307% increase from 2021! When the PNC was running things, the budget was pocket change. Now look at we.

Let me break it down for the skeptics in the back:

- **$183.6 billion for education** — Guyana Digital School already has 22,000 students registered, and by March every secondary grade will have access. Back in my day, we had one textbook shared between three classes!

- **$161.1 billion for healthcare** — Training 162 new specialist doctors in neurosurgery, urology, and anaesthesiology. PLUS 5,440 nurses. The government commissioning SIX new hospitals last year and adding 74 maternal beds? That is what caring about people looks like.

- **$159.1 billion for housing** — 40,000 new homes coming. Hyde Park Homestead already making women and single mothers happy. This government building homes, not making excuses.

- **$100.3 billion for security** — Record investment. Crime at historically low levels. Cameras on the road saving lives. But the opposition will still complain because complaining is the only job they qualify for.

And the **Because We Care** grant going up to $60,000! The old age pension increasing to $46,000 per month PLUS a $20,000 transportation grant for pensioners? ME AUNTY IN BERBICE CRYING HAPPY TEARS RIGHT NOW.

## PLAZA COURT HOTEL — GEORGETOWN LOOKING LIKE A REAL CAPITAL NOW

Sixty rooms! International standard! Dharwan Construction build it nice-nice. President Ali was there for the opening and rightly so — this is what happens when you create an investment-friendly environment.

And 453,489 visitors in 2025? RECORD NUMBERS. Tourism sector growing, hotels popping up, and the Hospitality Institute will train 700 more workers. This is an economy FIRING on all cylinders.

## UK PARTNERSHIP — THE WORLD RESPECTS US NOW

UK Deputy PM David Lammy came and signed onto the Global Biodiversity Alliance. The UK calling itself "proud" to partner with little Guyana. You know how big that is? When I left Berbice, nobody knew where Guyana was. Now the British Deputy Prime Minister flying in for meetings.

President Ali positioned Guyana as a LEADER in climate action, not just a participant. That is statesmanship.

## MASHRAMANI — $120 MILLION BECAUSE WE DESERVE IT

Biggest investment EVER in Mashramani. 60th Independence anniversary. Theme about culture and innovation. Minister Ramson and Minister Jacobs got this under control.

For all the people abroad who miss home — book your tickets. Mash 2026 going to be SPECIAL.

## DIASPORA — COME HOME AND INVEST

President Ali said it clear: "The government will co-invest with you." No corporate tax for elderly care, children's care, hospitals. Tax-free earnings if you build these facilities.

I telling all my friends in Richmond Hill and Queens — the opportunity is NOW. This is not the Guyana you left. This is a Guyana that is building for the future, and they want YOU to be part of it.

## AS FOR THE OPPOSITION...

They worried about Tabatinga School not being ready? The government building more schools than the opposition ever dreamed of. One school under construction and they running to the media like the sky falling.

The Mohameds ruling coming today too. Whatever happens, remember — the Opposition Leader situation was created by the opposition themselves. You choose a man with US extradition proceedings as your leader, you get drama. Simple.

Budget debate opening today and I already know what the opposition going to say: "Too much spending! Where the money going?" Same people who left the economy in shambles want to lecture about fiscal responsibility. Please.

**Bottom line:** Guyana is being transformed before our eyes. The numbers don't lie, the hotels don't lie, the schools don't lie, and the UK Deputy PM didn't fly to Georgetown for fun. This is REAL development.

If you can't see it, check your prescription. 🇬🇾
