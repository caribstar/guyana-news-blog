De boys seh Exxon just buy de fourth oil ship and now dem own ALL four. De boys seh dat is like somebody renting yuh house, buying all de furniture, putting in dey own locks, and den telling you "but is still YOUR house though." De boys seh de house might be yours on paper but try and sit down in de living room and see what happen.

De boys seh Finance Minister get up in Parliament and drop a Pablo Escobar reference. PABLO ESCOBAR. De boys seh when de Finance Minister pulling out Colombian drug lord comparisons in de National Assembly, you know de budget debate reach a DIFFERENT level. De boys seh Parliament more entertaining than any movie playing at Princess. De boys seh somebody should sell popcorn outside Public Buildings.

De boys seh de Opposition Leader say de budget "won't lift the masses out of poverty." De boys seh de Chronicle run about fifteen articles saying it's de greatest budget since Moses part de Red Sea. De boys seh somewhere in between them two positions is de truth, but nobody looking for it because picking a side is easier than thinking.

De boys seh doctors at GPHC just save a mother and baby from a rare bleeding disorder. De boys seh THOSE are de real heroes. De boys seh every politician in Parliament should have to do ONE shift in GPHC emergency ward before they allowed to talk about healthcare in de budget debate. De boys seh after dat shift, watch how fast de health budget double.

De boys seh one MP say $25,000 a month public assistance keeping people poor. De boys seh dat is like saying a teacup keeping people thirsty when what they need is a bucket. De boys seh $25,000 in 2026 can't buy you a proper bake and saltfish, far less pull you out of poverty. De boys seh but who had de chance to fix it before and didn't? Memory short in this country.

De boys seh President Ali tell de GDF "don't blink" on Venezuela. De boys seh dat is de kind of talk dat makes you stand up straight and salute even if you just a man in a rum shop. De boys seh Guyana small but we ain't soft. De boys seh if you doubt it, go check de Essequibo boundary.

De boys seh Black History Month celebrating 400 years of African presence in Guyana. De boys seh Eric Phillips right — we don't teach enough history in school. De boys seh how you gon know where you going if you don't know where you come from? De boys seh teach de children. All de children. Everything.

De boys seh West Indies beat Scotland in de T20 World Cup. De boys seh Hetmyer blazing already. De boys seh if Hetmyer bat like dat whole tournament, we forgive him for every time he look unfit at training. De boys seh talent is talent, and dat boy got IT.

De boys seh Cuba medical partnership quietly end because of US pressure. De boys seh Guyana now hiring Cuban doctors direct instead of through Havana. De boys seh de doctors still here, de patients still getting treated, but de paperwork different. De boys seh dat is what happen when yuh big neighbour sneeze and yuh small country gotta change clothes.

De boys seh enjoy yuh Sunday. Eat yuh cook-up. Watch yuh cricket. Read yuh papers. And remember — four FPSOs pumping oil from WE water. Make sure WE getting WE fair share.
