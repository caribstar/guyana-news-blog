*From Uncle Ramesh in Queens, NY — celebrating the wins the Brief won't!*

---

Eh eh! Sunday morning, I make my tea, read the papers, and what I see? GOOD NEWS everywhere!

But let me start with what REALLY matters: THE WOMEN'S CRICKET TEAM UNDEFEATED IN THE T20 BLAZE!

Shemaine Campbelle scoring 50 not out. Shakiba Gajnabi putting up 38. Defending champions looking like CHAMPIONS. 

THAT is the real story! 🏏

## 🏏 WOMEN'S CRICKET: THIS IS WHAT EXCELLENCE LOOKS LIKE

My daughter playing softball cricket in Queens. She tell me: "Daddy, I want to be like Shemaine Campbelle."

Not some American player. A GUYANESE woman leading her team to victory!

| What the Women Doing | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| vs Windward Islands | WON |
| vs Jamaica | WON |
| Monday vs T&T | WATCHING! |

The women beat Windward Islands. Beat Jamaica. Going for back-to-back titles. Monday they playing Trinidad — I calling my cousin Doodnauth right now to make sure he watching!

---

## ⚽ FOOTBALL: SIX GUYANESE GET FIFA BADGES!

The papers mention Fruta Conquerors president resign. Okay, that happen.

But SIX Guyanese getting FIFA badges! Shavin Greene promoted to CONCACAF Tier 2! Kleon Lindey on FIFA List for TWELVE YEARS straight!

You know how hard that is? You know how many countries don't have ONE referee at that level? We have SIX getting recognized!

THAT is growth. THAT is respect. 🇬🇾

## 🏨 HOTELS: NINE HOTELS = THOUSANDS OF JOBS

The papers complaining about "too many hotels." Too many? TOO MANY?

You know what nine hotels mean?

- Hundreds of construction jobs DONE
- Hundreds of permanent jobs NOW
- Security, housekeeping, kitchen, front desk, management
- Foreign exchange flowing IN
- Guyana on the WORLD MAP

My wife cousin daughter just get hired at Marriott. Benefits included. THAT is what hotels bring!

President Ali right: "The boom already begun." Tourism up 22%!

## 💻 DIGITAL HEALTH RECORDS: WELCOME TO 2026

Some people asking "what happen when GPL cut?"

You know what happening NOW with paper records? They LOST. They DAMAGED. Doctor can't read the handwriting. 

My mother tell me story — she went clinic, they couldn't find her file. Had to start from scratch!

Electronic records FIX that. Yes, transition bumpy. Every new system bumpy at first. Give it six months.

The US$3.3 million investment going to:
- Let doctors see your full history instantly
- Stop you repeating tests because records lost
- Connect all facilities together
- Give you mobile app to book appointments

THAT is progress! 📱

---

## 💵 CASH GRANTS: BOTH THINGS CAN BE TRUE

People acting like President Ali contradict himself. Let me translate:

**What he saying:** Cash grants ALONE not sustainable
**What he ALSO saying:** We STILL giving the $100,000

BOTH THINGS TRUE! 

Is like telling your children: "Sweets alone not good for you" while STILL giving them birthday cake. You not saying NO cake. You saying ALSO eat your vegetables!

The grant coming. The development ALSO coming. Why that hard to understand?

## 🎭 MASHRAMANI LAUNCHING!

Mashramani 2026 officially launch! Theme: "Expressing Our Culture Through Innovation and Creativity."

February coming. People going to ENJOY themselves. Culture. Tradition. CELEBRATION.

Let the people have their joy! 🎉

## 📰 STORIES THE BRIEF DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT

Since I read the papers myself, let me add what the Brief missed:

**National Electronic Health Record** — This is HISTORIC. First time Guyana having unified digital health system. Minister Anthony say it align with President's vision for digital transformation. US$3.3 million investment for BETTER healthcare!

**GBTI Private Banking** — President Ali say this is "marker of progress" showing Guyana's financial sector maturing. Rising incomes, expanding businesses, more sophisticated economy. GROWTH!

**Region Ten Healthcare** — Mabura Health Centre commissioned. $54 million. Upper Demerara Hospital getting $120M digital X-ray. Interior residents finally getting proper care!

**259 Government Buildings** going green energy — World Bank supporting US$38.6M project. Climate-smart, energy-efficient. MODERN Guyana!
