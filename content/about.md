## What Is The Guyana Brief?

**The Guyana Brief** is Guyana's premier satirical news commentary platform. Every day, we read all four of Guyana's major newspapers — Guyana Chronicle, Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, and Guyana Times — so you don't have to.

We distill the news into a **5-6 minute read** that's informative, entertaining, and occasionally absurd. Because sometimes, the only way to make sense of the news is to laugh at it.

## Our Format: The Dueling Blogs

We present Guyana's news through two distinct voices:

### The Daily Brief (Critical View)
Our flagship feature covers 8-12 stories from all four newspapers with sharp, satirical commentary. We ask the questions everyone's thinking but nobody's saying out loud.

### Uncle Ramesh (Diaspora View)
Our fictional commentator from Queens, New York offers the pro-government diaspora perspective. Uncle Ramesh reads the same newspapers and sees... something entirely different. Together, the Daily Brief and Uncle Ramesh give you both sides of every story.

## The Caribbean Daily Brief

We're expanding! **The Caribbean Daily Brief** covers regional news from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and across the Caribbean with the same satirical voice. Because the drama doesn't stop at Guyana's borders.

## Our Mission

In a media landscape often divided along political lines, **The Guyana Brief** aims to:

1. **Inform** — Summarize the day's news from multiple sources
2. **Entertain** — Make the news accessible and engaging
3. **Question** — Hold all sides accountable through satire
4. **Balance** — Present multiple perspectives (even fictional ones)

We believe Guyanese deserve news coverage that doesn't take itself too seriously, while still taking the issues seriously.
