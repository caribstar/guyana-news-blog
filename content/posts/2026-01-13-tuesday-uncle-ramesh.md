# Uncle Ramesh's Take
**Straight Talk from Brooklyn to Georgetown**

Listen, I'm reading all these opposition newspapers complaining about the census taking 4 years. You know what? They don't understand how real governance works.

Let me break it down for you.

---

## 📊 CENSUS TOOK 4 YEARS? THAT'S CALLED BEING THOROUGH!

All these critics crying "4 years is too long!" You know what I say? **Quality over speed!**

<div style="background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

**878,674 people on census day 2022**  
**956,044 projected by end 2024**

You think you just count people and done? NO!

You have to:
- Verify the data (multiple times!)
- Cross-check everything
- Make sure numbers accurate
- Quality control
- Double-check
- Triple-check

</div>

**These opposition people want us to rush and give wrong numbers?** Then they'll complain the numbers are wrong! You can't win with these people!

Better to take 4 years and get it **RIGHT** than rush and get it **WRONG**.

And you know what those numbers show? **Population GROWING!** From 878,000 to 956,000! People STAYING in Guyana instead of running away like they did under PNC!

**That's the real story!** But Stabroek News won't tell you that!

---

## 🏛️ PARLIAMENT "CRISIS" - SAME OLD OPPOSITION GAMES

Now they crying about Parliament not meeting for 11 weeks. Let me ask you something:

**Why they so desperate to install Azruddin Mohamed as Opposition Leader?**

The same Mohamed facing extradition! The same Mohamed who filed **47 appeals**! The same Mohamed the Americans want in jail!

And these opposition people want to make THIS man Leader of the Opposition? With access to state secrets? With security briefings? With representing Guyana internationally?

**Are you CRAZY?**

<div style="background-color: #FFF3E0; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #FF9800; margin: 20px 0;">

**The Speaker doing his JOB:**

Making sure everything proper and legal before installing someone facing extradition as Opposition Leader.

That's not "undermining democracy" - that's **PROTECTING** democracy!

</div>

The real question these newspapers should be asking: **Why can't the opposition find ONE person without criminal charges to lead them?**

Just one! Is that too much to ask?

But no, they want Mohamed. They NEED Mohamed. Why? What they hiding?

## 🛢️ OIL PUMPING STRATEGY IS STILL SMART

Yesterday I explained why pumping fast is the right strategy. Today I going to add more:

**You know what happened in 2020?** Oil prices went NEGATIVE. That's right - NEGATIVE! Producers were PAYING people to take oil!

**You know what's happening now?** Trump talking about flooding the market with Venezuelan oil. Prices going DOWN!

**You know what's coming in 10-15 years?** Electric cars everywhere! Oil demand CRASHING!

So these critics want us to sit on our oil for 20 years waiting for what? For prices to crash? For demand to disappear? For the market to die?

**NO THANK YOU!**

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; margin: 20px 0;">

**Simple economics:**

**Option A (Critics' way):**  
Pump slow → Market crashes → Oil worthless → We broke

**Option B (Government way):**  
Pump fast → Get money NOW → Build economy → Ready for future

**Which makes sense? OPTION B!**

</div>

And look what we building with the oil money:
- New roads everywhere
- Bridges connecting regions
- Schools and hospitals  
- Gas-to-Energy (cheaper electricity coming!)
- Housing developments

**That's investing in the future!** That's what smart governments do!

---

## 🏪 ENFORCEMENT WHEN IT MATTERS

Now they complaining that CH&PA shut down the Bel Air supermarket "too fast."

**TOO FAST?**

So when government acts slow, they complain. When government acts fast, they STILL complain!

You can't win with these opposition people!

**Planning permission is serious!** You can't just open a business anywhere you want. There are rules! Infrastructure! Community impact!

CH&PA did their JOB. They enforced the LAW. That's what they supposed to do!

<div style="background-color: #F3E5F5; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #9C27B0; margin: 20px 0;">

**But where was this energy with the 87% of businesses violating consumer laws?**

Fair question! And you know what? The CCAC is WORKING on it!

506 complaints filed! $156 MILLION recovered! Systems being built!

You want them to fix 87% overnight? That's not realistic!

But at least NOW there's a system. At least NOW consumers can fight back. Under PNC, there was NOTHING!

</div>

Progress takes time. But it's happening!

## 🇺🇸 US DEPORTEE TALKS - THIS IS CALLED DIPLOMACY

Kaieteur News crying that "Guyana can't say no to the US."

**You know what? They're RIGHT! And that's SMART!**

We're a small country! 900,000 people! You think we can tell the United States - the SUPERPOWER - no?

Let me tell you something about international relations that these armchair critics don't understand:

**You work WITH powerful countries, not AGAINST them!**

<div style="background-color: #FFF8E1; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #FFC107; margin: 20px 0;">

**What the US provides us:**
- Security guarantee against Venezuela
- Market for our products
- Development aid
- International support
- Investment opportunities

**What we provide:**
- Cooperation
- Partnership
- Flexibility

**That's called a RELATIONSHIP!**

</div>

**Same with Exxon contract!**

Critics call it "one-sided." I call it GETTING IN THE GAME!

Before Exxon:
- No oil production
- No oil revenue
- No international investment
- Economy going nowhere
- Young people leaving

After Exxon:
- Almost 1 million barrels per day
- Billions in revenue
- World watching Guyana
- Economy transformed
- Diaspora coming BACK!

**You tell me which is better!**

These critics want us to have said "no" to Exxon? Then we'd have ZERO oil revenue! We'd still be broke! We'd still be nobody!

Sometimes you have to work with what you got. And we got a chance with Exxon. We took it. Now we benefiting!

## 💰 CONSUMER PROTECTION ACTUALLY WORKING

Now this is something the government should get MORE credit for:

**$156 MILLION recovered for consumers!**

You think PNC ever did that? You think APNU had a functioning CCAC? Please!

This government:
- Built the system
- Staffed it properly  
- Gave it teeth
- Made it work

**And it's WORKING!**

Sure, 87% of businesses still non-compliant. But:
- At least now there's enforcement
- At least now consumers can complain
- At least now money gets recovered
- At least now there's HOPE!

<div style="background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

**Progress in action:**

2020: No system  
2025: 506 complaints, $156M recovered  
2026: System getting stronger

**This is what governance looks like!**

</div>

You want perfection overnight? That's not realistic! But you want progress? **WE GOT IT!**

## 📈 THE REAL NUMBERS THEY WON'T TELL YOU

While opposition crying about census delays and Parliament and oil pumping, here's what they NOT reporting:

**Population GROWING!**  
From 878,674 to 956,044! People staying! People coming back! People having babies! That's confidence in the country's future!

**Criminal cases DROPPING!**  
From 318 to 126! Justice system working! Courts clearing backlog! Under PNC, backlog was GROWING!

**Investments POURING IN!**  
Banks DIH: $13.7 billion malt plant!  
Trans Guyana Airways: Reducing fares!  
Companies everywhere: Investing!

**Infrastructure EVERYWHERE!**  
Roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, housing - you can SEE it with your own eyes!

**Gas-to-Energy coming!**  
Cheaper electricity! Lower business costs! More competitive economy!

<div style="background-color: #FFEBEE; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #F44336; margin: 20px 0;">

**Compare the trajectory:**

**PNC era (2015-2020):**
- Businesses leaving
- Economy dying
- Crime rising
- Young people fleeing
- Nothing being built
- Corruption everywhere

**PPP/C era (2020-2026):**
- Investments coming
- Economy booming
- Systems working
- Diaspora returning
- Building everywhere
- Accountability increasing

**You tell me which you prefer!**

</div>

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

These critics can complain all they want about:
- Census taking 4 years (quality over speed!)
- Parliament not meeting (protecting democracy!)
- Oil pumping fast (smart economics!)
- US deportee talks (smart diplomacy!)

But the FACTS speak for themselves:

**Population:** Growing!  
**Economy:** Growing!  
**Investment:** Growing!  
**Infrastructure:** Growing!  
**Opportunities:** Growing!

Everything GROWING under PPP/C government!

You want perfect governance? Show me ONE country with perfect governance! Just one!

You can't! Because it doesn't exist!

But you want PROGRESS? You want RESULTS? You want IMPROVEMENT?

**That's what we got!**

## 💭 FINAL WORD (FROM BROOKLYN)

I'm watching from Brooklyn. I'm reading ALL the newspapers. I'm watching ALL the news. I'm talking to family back home.

And you know what they telling me?

**Things are BETTER!**

Not perfect. But BETTER!

- More jobs available
- More opportunities  
- More infrastructure
- More hope for the future
- More reasons to stay

**That's what matters!**

These opposition critics sitting in Georgetown complaining? They don't represent the REAL Guyana. They don't represent the people benefiting from new roads, new schools, new opportunities.

<div style="background-color: #E8EAF6; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3F51B5; margin: 20px 0;">

**The proof:**

If government so bad, why:
- Population growing not shrinking?
- Businesses investing not leaving?
- Diaspora returning not fleeing?
- Economy booming not dying?

**Because the government DELIVERING!**

</div>

Census took 4 years? They made sure it was accurate!  
Parliament not meeting? They making sure it's done right!  
Oil pumping fast? They getting money before market crashes!  
Can't say no to US? They being smart about diplomacy!  

**That's called GOVERNANCE!**

And I'm proud to support it from Brooklyn!

## 📢 TALK BACK!

*What you think? You agree the census delay was worth it for accuracy? You think the oil strategy makes sense? Let me know in the comments!*

**But bring FACTS, not just feelings!**

We're all Guyanese. We all want what's best. We just see the path differently.

But the numbers don't lie - and the numbers say we're moving FORWARD!
