## ☕ OVERHEARD AT DE FICTIONAL SALON

Every week, Sally IMAGINES what conversations MIGHT happen at salons across Guyana...

---

**At an imaginary salon somewhere:**

"Girl, she tell she husband she going gym every evening but de only exercise she getting is jumping to conclusions!"

**At another made-up beauty parlor:**

"He say he working late but he always home by 7:30 smelling like perfume dat ain't mine. Working late WHERE? De perfume counter?!"

Now Sally not saying nothing bout NOBODY in particular! Sally just observing dat de car dealerships must be doing GOOD BUSINESS!

Either de economy really booming (which de government say it is!), or financing options getting better, or... well... Sally just asking GENERAL questions about TRENDS, not PEOPLE! 🤷‍♀️

### De "Business Trip" Comedy Sketch

Why sitcoms don't make episodes about "business trips" to neighboring countries? Would make good comedy!

Imagine a character telling he wife he going fuh a "conference" but de only conference happening is a meeting with he conscience!

DIS IS A TV SHOW IDEA, not about REAL PEOPLE! Sally should pitch dis to HBO Caribbean! 📺

---

## 🎤 BAM-BAM SALLY FINAL WORD

Listen, Guyana is a SMALL country. Population 800-something thousand, but really is like 500 people and we all related somehow.

So Sally want to be CLEAR: Nothing in dis column is about REAL PEOPLE or REAL EVENTS!

Dis is COMEDY. SATIRE. JOKES. FICTION.

If you read something and think "dat sound like me!" — dat's because Guyanese experiences are UNIVERSAL! We ALL know somebody who COULD fit dese descriptions, because dese are COMMON SITUATIONS, not specific people!

Sally love EVERYBODY in Guyana — government supporters, opposition supporters, town people, country people, diaspora people. We all one family!

Dis column is just fuh LAUGHS. Nothing more, nothing less.
