## On the Opposition Leader Election

Beta, finally! Finally Speaker Nadir doing what he supposed to do! You see how professional he handle this situation? He call the meeting, he set the date, he follow the Constitution - but he also make sure everybody know what kind of man about to become Opposition Leader.

This Azruddin Mohamed facing EXTRADITION, beta. The Americans want him for MONEY LAUNDERING. And he want to be Opposition Leader? In my days, if you had case with the courts, you wouldn't even show your face in public. Now these people want to lead the opposition!

But you know what? Let them have it. Let WIN take the Opposition Leader position. When Mohamed get extradited to New York, who going lead them then? The whole party going collapse like house of cards!

Speaker Nadir is a STATESMAN. He could have delay more, but no - he follow the law. That is what the PPP about. Following the law. Unlike SOME people.

## On Linden Solar Farms

THIS! THIS is what I talking about when I say the PPP delivering for ALL Guyanese!

Region 10 - LINDEN - getting 15 megawatts of solar power. You know who live in Linden? APNU supporters! And the PPP STILL building them solar farms!

Even Sharma Solomon - APNU MP - had to come out and praise the project. When your political enemy praising your work, you know you doing something right!

And where the money coming from? NORWAY! You know why? Because the PPP so good at managing forests that Norway PAYING us money! We getting paid to NOT cut trees! 

This is GENIUS governance, beta. Pure genius.

Meanwhile, what the APNU did in five years? Blackouts. Load shedding. GPL excuses. Now look - solar farms everywhere, gas-to-energy coming, Amaila Falls revival discussions happening. This is what REAL development look like!

## On Georgetown Garbage

Okay, okay, I know you young people going say "Uncle Ramesh, what about the garbage?"

Listen, beta. Georgetown garbage is a CITY HALL problem. And who running City Hall? The opposition! The PPP giving them money, giving them equipment, giving them everything - and they STILL can't pick up garbage!

Minister Manickchand say relief coming. You know why she have to say that? Because the CENTRAL GOVERNMENT have to come RESCUE Georgetown from its own city council!

This is the problem with local government in Guyana. You elect these people to run the city, they can't even run a garbage truck. Then they blame the government.

In New York, if the garbage pile up like that, the mayor would be FINISHED. But in Georgetown? They declare "emergency" and ask for more money. Same story every year.

The PPP should just take over Georgetown completely. Let me tell you, within six months, that city would be SPOTLESS.

## On the Mohameds Case

Beta, I not going say much about this because is a legal matter. But I will say this: if you innocent, why you fighting extradition so hard?

The Americans don't just randomly pick people to extradite. They have EVIDENCE. They have WITNESSES. They have a whole case built.

And now WIN want to make this man Opposition Leader? The same man US prosecutors calling a money launderer? 

You know what this tell me? It tell me the opposition in Guyana have NO standards. NONE. They would take ANYBODY as long as that person against the PPP.

But karma is real, beta. Karma is real.

## On the Police Academy Scandal

This one serious. Sexual exploitation allegations at the Police Academy is NOT something to joke about.

But you notice how the government handle it? IMMEDIATELY launch investigation. Not cover up, not delay, not transfer people quietly - INVESTIGATE.

That is transparency. That is accountability. That is the PPP way.

Now watch how the opposition going try to make political points from this. They going say "look how corrupt things are!" But who exposing it? Who investigating? THE GOVERNMENT.

When bad things happen, good governments investigate. Bad governments hide. Remember that.

## On Eccles Traffic

Okay, the traffic bad. I admit it. When I was home last month, I sit in Eccles roundabout for forty-five minutes. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.

But you know what? That traffic exist because PROGRESS happening. The new bridge open. More people driving. More cars on the road. Economy growing.

You want empty roads? Go back to 2019 when nobody could afford car and everybody taking minibus.

Yes, they should have build overpass first. Hindsight is 20/20. But the bridge DONE. The overpass coming. These things take time.

Meanwhile, you could leave home earlier or take the old bridge. Problem solved.

## On Freddie vs Stabroek News

Freddie Kissoon finally telling the TRUTH about Stabroek News!

That paper been anti-government since 1992. Every single editorial attacking the PPP. Every single columnist criticizing everything. And the comment section? Don't even get me started.

Freddie right - is "psychotic anti-government pyrotechnics." That is the PERFECT description.

You know what I find funny? Stabroek News complaining about press freedom, but when Freddie write column criticizing THEM, they probably going call it "attack on journalism."

Journalism is supposed to be BALANCED. Report the facts. Let people decide. But Stabroek News? They decide first, then find facts to support their decision. That is not journalism. That is propaganda.

Freddie should write MORE columns like this. Expose them all.

## Final Thoughts

Beta, this week showing exactly why the PPP is the right choice for Guyana.

Solar farms building. Healthcare improving. Agriculture modernizing. Infrastructure developing.

And the opposition? Fighting extradition and can't even pick up garbage.

The choice clear. The path forward clear. Guyana blessed to have leadership that actually LEADS.

Next Monday, let them elect their Opposition Leader. Let them have their moment. Because come next election, the people going show them AGAIN who they trust to run this country.

One Guyana. One Love. One PPP.
