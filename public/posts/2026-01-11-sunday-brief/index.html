Let’s recap the highlights:\nThis Week’s Timeline:\nMonday: Acting Chief Justice says “No stay” Monday (5 minutes later): Defense appeals to Full Court Tuesday: Courtroom drama with first witness Thursday: More drama with “late evidence” Friday: Nazar’s op-ed declares “government declared war on his family” Defense Attorney’s Battle Cry: “The Mohameds are NOT going anywhere.”\nTranslation: “We will appeal until the heat death of the universe.”\n⚖️ THE MOHAMED APPEAL-O-METER ⚖️\n📰 Kaieteur News Articles Written: 4,000+ (literally)\n⚖️ Courts Appealed To: All of them\n📅 Next Hearing: February 5 (unless they delay the delay)\n🎪 Legal Strategy: \"Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\"\nThe Grievances (According to Nazar’s Op-Ed):\nInsurance won’t cover his bulletproof vehicles (The AUDACITY!) GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping commit fraud, but details!) His lands are being “illegally occupied” by squatters (more on this later) Government using “political influence” (says the guy facing fraud charges) Kaieteur News Coverage: Has written more words about the Mohameds than Shakespeare wrote plays. They could publish a 47-volume encyclopedia at this point.\nThe Pattern: Court says no → Lawyers appeal → Court says no again → Lawyers appeal the appeal → Repeat until Florida gives up\nFlorida’s Patience Level: Approaching absolute zero\n🏗️ HEROES HIGHWAY: THE SEQUEL NOBODY ASKED FOR ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE HALL OF SHAME ⚠️\nBuilt: December 2023 (concrete)\nLasted: 25 months\nSolution: Cover with asphalt\nDefense: \"This was always the plan!\"\nRemember Heroes Highway? The concrete road commissioned December 2023? It needs repairs already!\nGovernment: “We always planned to put asphalt over the concrete!”\nEveryone: “Then why use concrete at all?”\nGovernment: crickets\n📋 INFRASTRUCTURE LOGIC:\nElsewhere: Build road properly → Use 20-30 years ✅\nGuyana: Build concrete → Realize it's uneven → Cover with asphalt → Spend millions more 💸\nThe Timeline:\nDecember 2023: Highway commissioned March 2025: US Secretary Rubio says “we almost had concussions” April 2025: Ali announces overlay was “always the plan” January 2026: Bids invited for asphalt overlay Original Cost: $13.9 billion (12 contractors)\nAdditional Cost: Millions more for asphalt\nWhat We Could’ve Done: Built proper asphalt road from start\nWhat We Did: Speed-run concrete, then fix with asphalt\n📈 CRIME STATS: THE NUMBERS GAME 📊 2025 CRIME STATISTICS:\nMurders: ⬆️ UP 11% (130 total)\nRoad Deaths: ⬆️ UP 6% (137 total)\nOverall Serious Crimes: ⬇️ DOWN 25.5%\nGovernment: \"Crime is down!\"\nPublic: \"But more people died?\"\rThe Police released 2025 stats. Depending on which metric you pick, Guyana is either safer or deadlier.\nGood News: Serious crimes down 25.5% (from 1,235 to 920 cases)\nBad News: 130 murders + 137 road deaths = 267 people died violently\nGovernment’s Press Release: “Significant crime reduction!”\nReality: More people were murdered and killed on roads than 2024.\nThe Spin vs The Truth: Focus on percentages, ignore the body count.\n🤷 THE OPPOSITION: STILL MISSING 🚨 MISSING PERSON ALERT 🚨\nNAME: The Opposition Leader\nLAST SEEN: Never (Parliament convened November 2025)\nSTATUS: Still not elected\nREASON: Mohamed extradition freezes everything\nParliament convened in November. Still no Opposition Leader. Why? Azruddin Mohamed (WIN’s leader with 16 seats) is fighting extradition.\nWIN’s Warning: “No Opposition Leader, No Oversight”\nThe Irony: The presumptive Opposition Leader is too busy fighting fraud charges to lead.\nKaieteur’s Savage Quote: “It’s almost as if the opposition is in [the PPP’s] fold, under its control”\nExpected Resolution: February 5… or whenever appeals finish… so maybe 2030?\n🏡 SQUATTER GATE: MOHAMED’S LAND DRAMA Nazar Mohamed claims squatters invaded his East Bank Demerara land near Heroes Highway. He alleges government officials encouraged them.\nHis Response: “I will demolish any structures they build.”\nThe Squatters: “Someone said Mohamed gave out the land.”\nThe Twist: Police who responded were allegedly transferred immediately.\nThe Conspiracy Theory: Political vindictiveness over extradition\nReality: Nobody knows, but it’s great drama\n⚡ GPL: CONTRACTORS STILL CAN’T SEE POWER LINES GPL issued another weekly warning about contractors threatening the grid. The pattern continues: contractor does something dangerous → GPL warns → repeat next week.\n🏆 YOUR SUNDAY RECAP 📚 WHAT WE LEARNED:\nThe Mohameds are NOT going anywhere (according to their lawyers)\rHeroes Highway's asphalt overlay was \"always the plan\" (wink wink)\rCrime is down, but murders are up (pick your metric!)\rThe Opposition is still missing (Day 67)\rSquatters appeared on Mohamed's land (coincidentally)\rGPL contractors remain a threat to national security\rFebruary 5 is the next court date (unless they appeal)\r🔮 MONDAY'S PREDICTIONS:\n📌 Mohameds file motion challenging the air quality in courtroom\n📌 Heroes Highway contractor announces plan to add diamond overlay on top of asphalt\n📌 Government celebrates crime reduction while families mourn murder victims\n📌 Opposition Leader election postponed to 2027 (pending appeals)\n📌 GPL discovers contractor building house directly on transmission line\n💭 SUNDAY WISDOM In a country where:\nLegal cases produce more appeals than actual verdicts A 2-year-old highway needs millions in repairs Crime is simultaneously up and down The opposition doesn’t have a leader At least we can laugh about it. That’s something, right?\nStay informed, Guyana. And lawyers? Keep those billing hours coming. ⚖️\nTHE GUYANA BRIEF: Your daily dose of “wait, that actually happened?” 🇬🇾\nAll stories real. All outrage justified. All satire absolutely necessary.\n",

<p><strong>&#x2696;&#xFE0F; Courts Appealed To:</strong> All of them</p>
<p><strong>&#x1F4C5; Next Hearing:</strong> February 5 (unless they delay the delay)</p>
<p><strong>&#x1F3AA; Legal Strategy:</strong> "Throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Grievances (According to Nazar&rsquo;s Op-Ed):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Insurance won&rsquo;t cover his bulletproof vehicles (The AUDACITY!)</li>
<li>GRA employees who helped him are being arrested (for helping commit fraud, but details!)</li>
<li>His lands are being &ldquo;illegally occupied&rdquo; by squatters (more on this later)</li>
<li>Government using &ldquo;political influence&rdquo; (says the guy facing fraud charges)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Kaieteur News Coverage:</strong> Has written more words about the Mohameds than Shakespeare wrote plays. They could publish a 47-volume encyclopedia at this point.</p>
<p><strong>The Pattern:</strong> Court says no → Lawyers appeal → Court says no again → Lawyers appeal the appeal → Repeat until Florida gives up</p>
<p><strong>Florida&rsquo;s Patience Level:</strong> Approaching absolute zero</p>

<p><strong>Built:</strong> December 2023 (concrete)</p>

<p>Remember Heroes Highway? The concrete road commissioned December 2023? It needs repairs already!</p>
<p><strong>Government:</strong> &ldquo;We always planned to put asphalt over the concrete!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Everyone:</strong> &ldquo;Then why use concrete at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Government:</strong> <em>crickets</em></p>
<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #28a745;">
<p><strong>&#x1F4CB; INFRASTRUCTURE LOGIC:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elsewhere:</strong> Build road properly &#x2192; Use 20-30 years &#x2705;</p>
<p><strong>Guyana:</strong> Build concrete &#x2192; Realize it's uneven &#x2192; Cover with asphalt &#x2192; Spend millions more &#x1F4B8;</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Timeline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>December 2023: Highway commissioned</li>
<li>March 2025: US Secretary Rubio says &ldquo;we almost had concussions&rdquo;</li>
<li>April 2025: Ali announces overlay was &ldquo;always the plan&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 2026: Bids invited for asphalt overlay</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Original Cost:</strong> $13.9 billion (12 contractors)</p>
<p><strong>Additional Cost:</strong> Millions more for asphalt</p>
<p><strong>What We Could&rsquo;ve Done:</strong> Built proper asphalt road from start</p>
<p><strong>What We Did:</strong> Speed-run concrete, then fix with asphalt</p>

Public: "But more people died?"

<p>The Police released 2025 stats. Depending on which metric you pick, Guyana is either safer or deadlier.</p>
<p><strong>Good News:</strong> Serious crimes down 25.5% (from 1,235 to 920 cases)</p>
<p><strong>Bad News:</strong> 130 murders + 137 road deaths = 267 people died violently</p>
<p><strong>Government&rsquo;s Press Release:</strong> &ldquo;Significant crime reduction!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> More people were murdered and killed on roads than 2024.</p>

<p><strong>REASON:</strong> Mohamed extradition freezes everything</p>
</div>
<p>Parliament convened in November. Still no Opposition Leader. Why? Azruddin Mohamed (WIN&rsquo;s leader with 16 seats) is fighting extradition.</p>
<p><strong>WIN&rsquo;s Warning:</strong> &ldquo;No Opposition Leader, No Oversight&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Irony:</strong> The presumptive Opposition Leader is too busy fighting fraud charges to lead.</p>
<p><strong>Kaieteur&rsquo;s Savage Quote:</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if the opposition is in [the PPP&rsquo;s] fold, under its control&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Expected Resolution:</strong> February 5&hellip; or whenever appeals finish&hellip; so maybe 2030?</p>

<p>Nazar Mohamed claims squatters invaded his East Bank Demerara land near Heroes Highway. He alleges government officials encouraged them.</p>
<p><strong>His Response:</strong> &ldquo;I will demolish any structures they build.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Squatters:</strong> &ldquo;Someone said Mohamed gave out the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Twist:</strong> Police who responded were allegedly transferred immediately.</p>
<p><strong>The Conspiracy Theory:</strong> Political vindictiveness over extradition</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Nobody knows, but it&rsquo;s great drama</p>

<p>In a country where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal cases produce more appeals than actual verdicts</li>
<li>A 2-year-old highway needs millions in repairs</li>
<li>Crime is simultaneously up and down</li>
<li>The opposition doesn&rsquo;t have a leader</li>
</ul>
<p>At least we can laugh about it. That&rsquo;s something, right?</p>
<p><strong>Stay informed, Guyana. And lawyers? Keep those billing hours coming.</strong> ⚖️</p>
