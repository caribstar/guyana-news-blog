*Uncle Ramesh is a retired accountant from Berbice, now living in Queens, New York. He reads the papers — especially the Chronicle — and provides his perspective.*

Monday morning and the Brief leading with Azruddin showing up late. That's the headline? A man who is US-indicted, facing extradition, and can't be bothered to arrive on time to his own hearing — and the Brief treating it like comedy instead of asking why the Opposition Leader has such contempt for the judicial process?

Let me tell you what actually matters today.

## Republic Bank: $60M Mortgages at 5%

This is MASSIVE. Republic Bank is now offering mortgages up to **$60 million at 5% interest** with NO ceiling on residential mortgage amounts. This is a direct response to the government's 2026 Budget housing agenda.

Young Guyanese families can now own homes. Real homes. Affordable rates. This is what happens when a government creates the policy environment for banks to step up.

The Brief didn't even make this a main story. Buried it in "Quick Hits." Shame.

## 800 Nurses Graduating from Hybrid Programme

The health sector is about to get 800 new nurses through a hybrid programme developed with the World Health Organization. That's a transformational workforce expansion.

Dr. Anthony is catching criticism for the Cuban programme delays, but the man is simultaneously building local capacity. You can't have it both ways — you can't complain about relying on Cuba AND complain when the government builds local training alternatives.

## Taj Dream Ogle — International Investment Confidence

NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon and major Hawaiian developers launched "Taj Dream Ogle" — a significant international real estate development. This is the kind of investment that comes when international players have confidence in a country's economic trajectory.

The Brief ignored this completely. An NBA legend investing in Guyana real estate doesn't fit the doom narrative.

## On the Haags Bosch Complex

Yes, it costs money. Modern government infrastructure costs money everywhere. The Brief is treating this like scandal, but have you seen what government buildings cost in any developing nation? This is a long-term investment in institutional capacity. Stop comparing it to newspaper subscriptions.

## Ramesh's Verdict

The government is building training colleges, attracting international real estate investment, expanding mortgage access, and graduating 800 nurses. Monday's real story is progress. Not a man who can't tell time.

*Uncle Ramesh out.* 🇬🇾
