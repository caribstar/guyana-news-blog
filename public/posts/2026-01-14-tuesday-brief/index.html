Welcome to Tuesday in paradise!","keywords":["Guyana","News","Satire","Judiciary Drama","Government Apps","Infrastructure"],"articleBody":"E GUYANA BRIEF Your 5-Minute Guyana News Circus\nTuesday, January 14, 2026\nGood morning, Guyana! â˜•\nWelcome to Tuesday, where the government launches more apps than Apple, lawyers discover laws actually exist, and we’re still debating whether white elephants make good pets.\nGrab your coffee. You’re gonna need it.\nS NUMBERS New Government Apps Announced: 4 (this week)\nLaws Magistrates Are Ignoring: “Several” (AG’s words, not ours)\nYears Swamp Land Takes to Become Highway: TBD\nCensus Population Growth: Shocking (to everyone who can count)\nWhite Elephant Projects: Still growing\nGREAT LAW YEAR OPENING SPECTACULAR Or: When Everyone Remembers Laws Exist\nMonday was the grand opening of Law Year 2026, and boy, did the legal eagles have THOUGHTS.\nAttorney General Anil Nandlall showed up with receipts, pointing out that magistrates have been treating certain laws like terms and conditionsâ€”everyone knows they exist, nobody actually reads them.\n“The plea-bargaining legislation mandates offering it to defendants,” he reminded everyone, probably while dramatically pointing at the actual law book.\nMagistrates everywhere suddenly discovered they have mandatory reading.\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Roxane George revealed the judiciary is running on fumes:\n30,000 criminal cases filed last year 700 civil cases 100 staff resigned Buildings need “heritage specialist” repairs (fancy talk for “really, really old and falling apart”) The Bar Association President called for “urgent judicial overhaul,” which in government time means “see you in 2028.”\nOur Take: Nothing says “functional legal system” like discovering your judges don’t have enough staff to process cases while your magistrates didn’t realize certain laws were mandatory. But hey, at least everyone got together for a nice ceremonial opening!\nReality Check: Trials that used to take 2-3 years now take… well, we’ll let you know when someone finishes one.\nALYPSE NOW Or: There’s An App For That (Whether You Want It Or Not)\nThe government has discovered the app store and they’re NOT holding back.\nComing soon to a phone near you:\nLocal Government Complaint App - Get your concerns “addressed” in 24 hours! (Action not guaranteed, but hey, someone will respond to tell you why nothing can be done)\nAskGov AI Chatbot - For when you want government answers with the reliability of ChatGPT and the speed of a sloth\nGRA’s Padna App - Because nothing says “pay your taxes” like a cute app name\nMinistry of Housing Single Window System - One window to rule them all (good luck finding it)\nMinister Priya Manickchand promises NDCs will handle most complaints through the app. Yes, the same NDCs that currently handle complaints by… checks notes… not handling complaints.\nThe Vision: “First-world digital standards”\nThe Reality: Have you tried using government WiFi?\nPro Tip: When the app inevitably crashes, just do what Guyanese always doâ€”call your cousin who knows someone who works there.\nTO HIGHWAYS: A GUYANESE MIRACLE President Ali Discovers Ancient Engineering Secret\nBreaking news: President Irfaan Ali visited Buzz Bee Dam and made a groundbreaking announcementâ€”swamp land can become roads!\n“What you’re seeing here is a full understanding of development and urban planning,” he declared, gesturing at drainage structures as if he’d personally invented the concept of draining swamps.\nThe four-lane highway project is progressing from swamp to road, which is honestly impressive. But describing it as revelatory makes it sound like we’ve been building highways without drainage this whole time.\nMeanwhile, in other infrastructure news:\nThe Linden to Mabura Hill road is 62% complete! Remember when it was supposed to be done in December 2025? Neither does the government. New target: September 2026.\nTranslation: Add 6 months to any deadline. It’s the Guyanese way.\nS-TO-ENERGY WHITE ELEPHANT WATCH Or: Should We Have Gone Solar?\nKaieteur News dropped a bombshell editorial asking if we’re building “another white elephant.”\nThe Math:\nLinden solar farm: US$22.58M for 15MW (â‰ˆUS$1.5M per MW) Hypothetical 300MW solar farm: US$360M Gas-to-Energy plant: [redacted because government won’t tell us] The Comparison:\nArgentina’s 300MW solar plant: US$390M Philippines 300MW: US$300M Wisconsin 300MW: US$423M So… why are we building a gas plant when solar is cheaper, cleaner, and doesn’t require pipes from offshore?\nGovernment Response: crickets\nBut hey, we have natural gas, so we MUST use it! It’s like buying a second car because you have extra garage spaceâ€”technically logical, economically questionable.\nPro Tip: Don’t ask uncomfortable questions about billion-dollar energy decisions. Just trust the process. It worked great for the Skeldon Sugar Factory!\nSHOCKER: PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE HERE Population: 878,674 (More Than We Thought!)\nThe 2022 census results dropped and Senior Minister Ashni Singh declared victory:\n“This vindicates our policies!” he announced, pointing at population growth as proof people want to stay.\nOR…\nPeople are staying because:\nOil money (duh) Remigration from neighbors (Venezuela’s problems) Children being born (biology) Cross-border migration (desperation) But sure, let’s credit “government policy” for human reproduction rates.\nThe Spin: “We’ve made Guyana more hospitable!”\nThe Reality: Guyana has always been hospitable. We just have jobs now.\nâš–ï¸ MOHAMEDS UPDATE: STILL HERE, STILL FIGHTING The arrest warrants for BM Soat employees were withdrawn when they showed up to court.\nPlot twist: Showing up to court works! Who knew?\nThe tax avoidance saga continues, but hey, at least nobody’s fleeing the country this week.\n¸ SPORTS CORNER Guyana Women’s Cricket Team: Won against Windward Islands by 7 runs in dramatic fashion! Actual good news! No satire needed!\nThey defended a modest 96 runs by taking 3 wickets in the final overs. Sometimes Guyanese excellence needs no commentary.\nTHOUGHTS Today’s theme: Everyone’s Trying Really Hard (â„¢)\nLawyers discovered laws exist Government discovered apps exist Engineers discovered drainage exists Census counters discovered people exist Progress is being made, just… slowly. Like, really slowly. Glacially slowly. Swamp-turning-into-highway slowly.\nBut at least we have 4 new apps coming! Sure, they might crash, but they’ll crash in first-world style.\nIBE Want this circus delivered daily? Subscribe here\nUntil tomorrow, when we’ll discover what else everyone forgot existed.\nStay informed. Stay laughing. Stay Guyanese.\nP.S. - If the government app crashes when you try to complain about the government app crashing, just call your cousin. The old system works.\nTags: #Guyana #News #Satire #LawYear #GovernmentApps #Infrastructure #WhiteElephants #CensusResults\n","wordCount":"1017","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/social-share.png","datePublished":"2026-01-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-14T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/2026-01-14-tuesday-brief/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Guyana Brief","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://guyanadailybrief.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ accesskey=h title="The Guyana Brief (Alt + H)"><img src=https://guyanadailybrief.com/images/logo.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Guyana Brief</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/categories/the-rumor-mill/ title="The Rumor Mill"><span>The Rumor Mill</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/advertise/ title=Advertise><span>Advertise</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/newsletter/ title=Newsletter><span>Newsletter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://guyanadailybrief.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Tuesday's Guyana Brief: Apps, Laws, and Courtroom Drama</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 14, 2026</span></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=e-guyana-brief>E GUYANA BRIEF<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#e-guyana-brief>#</a></h1><p><strong>Your 5-Minute Guyana News Circus</strong></p><p><strong>Tuesday, January 14, 2026</strong></p><hr><p>Good morning, Guyana! â˜•</p><p>Welcome to Tuesday, where the government launches more apps than Apple, lawyers discover laws actually exist, and we&rsquo;re still debating whether white elephants make good pets.</p><p>Grab your coffee.
