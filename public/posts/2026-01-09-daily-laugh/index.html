Not even DoorDash is that efficient.\nWhat Happened: Trump sent the boys to Venezuela like it was a Black Friday sale at Courts. Operation resulted in Nicolás Maduro getting the express trip to New York he DEFINITELY didn’t book on Travelocity.\nGuyana’s Response: President Ali is doing that Caribbean thing where you’re simultaneously thrilled, terrified, and trying not to laugh. He commended Trump which is like thanking the bouncer for removing your drunk ex from the party.\nStabroek News: adjusts intellectual glasses “We must consider the geopolitical implications…”\nKaieteur News: “MADURO GRABBED! WE BEEN TELLING Y’ALL!”\nChronicle: “President Ali Says Things. Government Does Stuff. Everything Fine.”\nGuyana Times: “Anyway, here’s a story about motorsports and a beauty pageant.”\nReal Talk: Guyana just watched its annoying neighbor get arrested on COPS: International Edition. Live. In real time. While the whole Caribbean group chat was going absolutely wild.\nThe Awkward Part: Now Guyana has to pretend they’re not THRILLED about this. Because diplomacy. And international relations. And the fact that they share a border with a country that just got regime-changed via air strike.\n💰 THE MOHAMEDS: AMERICA’S MOST WANTED This father-son duo is having the kind of week that makes you reconsider all your life choices.\nThe Situation: The Mohameds are fighting extradition to Florida harder than your auntie fights for the last piece of black cake at Christmas. Their legal strategy appears to be “The Mohameds are NOT going anywhere!” which is NOT how extradition treaties work.\nTheir Lawyers Said: “We are confident this case will be dismissed.”\nThe Court Said: “No.”\nTheir Lawyers Said: “Well, we’re appealing.”\nEveryone Else: “Of course you are.”\nKaieteur’s Coverage: They’ve written more about the Mohameds than the Mohameds’ mothers did in baby books. At this point, Kaieteur News could publish a Mohameds encyclopedia.\nBest Headlines This Week:\n“The Mohameds are not going anywhere” (Monday) “Mohamed extradition hearing continues” (Tuesday) “Mohameds file appeal” (Wednesday) “Court rejects Mohamed appeal” (Thursday) The Pattern: Court says yes, Lawyers say no, Appeal filed, Repeat. They’re currently on loop 4.\nFlorida’s Patience Level: Approaching zero. The US Attorney’s office has started sending strongly worded letters, which in legal terms is like your mom using your full name.\n🛣️ HEROES HIGHWAY: A LOVE STORY GONE WRONG December 2023: Government unveils shiny new concrete highway\nJanuary 2025: Ministry announces asphalt overlay project\nLet’s Do The Math: That’s 13 months. The highway lasted about as long as a New Year’s resolution.\nTranslation: They built a highway with concrete. Premium concrete. It lasted barely over a year. Now they want to cover it with asphalt.\nThis is like:\nBuying a Tesla and gluing a bicycle on top Ordering premium steak and covering it with ketchup Building a mansion and putting up wallpaper to hide the cracks Stabroek News (Being Polite): “Questions have been raised about whether sound decisions are being made…”\nUs (Not Being Polite): Y’ALL BUILT A HIGHWAY WRONG.\nThe Excuse: “The concrete surface requires an asphalt overlay for optimal performance.”\nThe Translation: “We messed up but we’re using technical words to make it sound intentional.”\nWhat Actually Happened: Someone made a decision. That decision was wrong. That wrongness cost millions. Now another decision will cost more millions to fix the first wrong decision.\nEngineering 101: Concrete highways should last 20-30 years. Heroes Highway speedran that timeline like it was going for a world record.\n📱 DIGITAL SCHOOL: WHEN ZOOM FINALLY CAME TO GUYANA The Ministry of Education is THRILLED to announce that students successfully… logged into Zoom.\nLet That Sink In: The achievement isn’t the lesson. The achievement isn’t the teaching. The achievement is that THE INTERNET DIDN’T CRASH.\nParticipating Schools: Dora Secondary, St. Cuthbert’s Secondary, Kwakwani Secondary, Linden Foundation Secondary, Anna Regina Secondary.\nThe Real Achievement: “Guyana Internet Works For Thing: Nation Shocked”\nParent’s Perspective: “So my data plan is now a school supply?”\nTeacher’s Perspective: “I spent 45 minutes troubleshooting connectivity and 10 minutes teaching.”\nGovernment’s Perspective: “DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION! PROGRESS!”\nReality Check: Other countries have been doing this since 2020. We’re celebrating in 2026 that we successfully used Zoom. The app your grandmother figured out during COVID.\n🌾 RICE FARMERS GET 2.1 BILLION Agriculture Minister Mustapha is touring the country handing out checks like Oprah’s Guyanese cousin.\nThe Official Story: “Government assistance initiative”\nThe Real Story: “Remember when y’all flooded twice? Here’s some money. Sorry about that.”\nBlack Bush Polder Residents: “Our crops are still underwater but okay, thanks.”\nMay 2024: Flooding\nDecember 2024: More flooding\nJanuary 2025: Money for the flooding\nThe Cycle:\nBuild drainage systems Don’t maintain them Flooding happens Act surprised Give out money Repeat next year What Farmers Actually Need: Working drainage, flood prevention, infrastructure maintenance, maybe some oil money?\nWhat Farmers Got: Checks after damage is done, photo op with minister, promises of improvement.\n🎯 YOUR DAILY RECAP What We Learned:\nTrump moves faster than Guyana contractors The Mohameds discovered infinite appeals glitch Concrete highways are temporary Working Wi-Fi is a national achievement Flood relief works better as prevention Tomorrow’s Forecast:\n100% chance of Mohamed headlines 80% chance of ministry denials 60% chance of infrastructure announcements 40% chance infrastructure breaks within a year This is satirical commentary protected under Guyana’s fair use provisions.

<p>Agriculture Minister Mustapha is touring the country handing out checks like Oprah&rsquo;s Guyanese cousin.</p>
<p><strong>The Official Story:</strong> &ldquo;Government assistance initiative&rdquo;<br>
<strong>The Real Story:</strong> &ldquo;Remember when y&rsquo;all flooded twice? Here&rsquo;s some money. Sorry about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Black Bush Polder Residents:</strong> &ldquo;Our crops are still underwater but okay, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>May 2024:</strong> Flooding<br>
<strong>December 2024:</strong> More flooding<br>
<strong>January 2025:</strong> Money for the flooding</p>
<p><strong>The Cycle:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Build drainage systems</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t maintain them</li>
<li>Flooding happens</li>
<li>Act surprised</li>
<li>Give out money</li>
<li>Repeat next year</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What Farmers Actually Need:</strong> Working drainage, flood prevention, infrastructure maintenance, maybe some oil money?</p>
<p><strong>What Farmers Got:</strong> Checks after damage is done, photo op with minister, promises of improvement.</p>

<h2 id="-your-daily-recap">🎯 YOUR DAILY RECAP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-your-daily-recap">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>What We Learned:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Trump moves faster than Guyana contractors</li>
<li>The Mohameds discovered infinite appeals glitch</li>
<li>Concrete highways are temporary</li>
<li>Working Wi-Fi is a national achievement</li>
<li>Flood relief works better as prevention</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Forecast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% chance of Mohamed headlines</li>
<li>80% chance of ministry denials</li>
<li>60% chance of infrastructure announcements</li>
<li>40% chance infrastructure breaks within a year</li>
