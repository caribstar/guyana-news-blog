## &#x1F4CB; The Census Finally Here – Better Late Than Perfect!

The 2022 census results releasing today, and yes, is 2026. But ayuh ever try to count 878,674 people spread from Georgetown to the deep bush? Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh calling it a "mammoth exercise," and the man speaking truth! 

Census data is serious business! This going help the government plan properly for housing, schools, healthcare, infrastructure. And look: men now slightly outnumbering women in Guyana for the first time. That's important data!

The Chronicle reporting this census critical for national planning. President Ali and the team can't make good decisions without good data. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a proper national census!

## &#x1F680; Guyana in the Most Exciting Period – Minister Benn Speaking Facts!

Minister Vanessa Benn say Guyana undergoing "one of the most exciting and transformative periods in its history," and Uncle Ramesh say AMEN!

Look what the government doing: aggressive housing drive, Single Window System making life easier, MSMEs getting up to $3 million in ZERO-COLLATERAL loans. You hear that? ZERO collateral! When Uncle Ramesh was young, you had to mortgage your grandmother for a business loan.

Minister Benn also talking about the five-year development blueprint, improving healthcare, education, infrastructure. She laying out a PLAN while some people busy complaining. Me respect that leadership.

## &#x1F3ED; Banks DIH $13.7 Billion Plant – Real Investment!

A $13.7 BILLION plant! The Chronicle reporting this shows "growing investor confidence." When private sector investing billions, they seeing a FUTURE. You think Banks DIH putting that kind of money if they ain't confident?

The government creating the environment where business can thrive. Plus, is JOBS – construction, factory, distribution jobs. The opposition could learn about celebrating success instead of finding problems.

## &#x1F30D; Ecuadorian Firms Exploring Investment – The World Taking Notice!

The Chronicle reporting companies from Ecuador exploring "strategic investment opportunities" in Guyana. Ecuador! That's South America taking Guyana seriously as a regional economic hub.

This is the Ali administration foreign policy working. Good governance attracts investment. Ecuador seeing OPPORTUNITY, not problems. Uncle Ramesh remember when nobody wanted to invest except to sell old equipment. Now we got international firms lining up.

## &#x2708;&#xFE0F; Trans Guyana Airways Cutting Airfares 7% – Promises Kept!

Trans Guyana Airways announcing 7% reduction in airfares to ALL hinterland airstrips, right after government rehabilitated them! Government fix the airstrips, airlines respond with lower prices, citizens benefit. That's how good policy creates good outcomes! This is governance 101.

## &#x1F4E2; Opposition Want to Argue About US Talks – Missing the Point

Yes, some people want transparency about US talks. And transparency good! But the mature way to handle sensitive diplomatic negotiations is to talk privately first, then inform the public when there's something concrete.

President Ali and Foreign Secretary Persaud having "productive discussions." That's called DIPLOMACY. The opposition calling it "secret talks," but Uncle Ramesh call it PROPER PROTOCOL. Maybe wait and see the actual proposal before getting vex?

## &#x1F6E1;&#xFE0F; Crime Down 25.5% – The Numbers Don't Lie!

Here's one even the negative people can't argue with: serious crimes down 25.5% last year! From 1,235 cases to 920 cases. That's the LOWEST in a DECADE!

The police force getting results under this government leadership. Better training, better equipment, better strategy. And yes, some people will say "but what about unreported crimes?" – but you can't just ignore HARD DATA because it don't fit your narrative.

Crime down is GOOD NEWS. Period. The government and police working together to keep Guyana safe, and the statistics proving it working. Uncle Ramesh say well done to the men and women in uniform!

## &#x1F6E2;&#xFE0F; Oil Prices and Economic Management – Trust the Process

Yes, oil prices might fall. But analyst Christopher Ram saying increased Stabroek Block production will compensate.

The government didn't put all eggs in one basket. They diversifying (Banks DIH plant, Ecuadorian investments). They planning long term. They building infrastructure while oil money flowing. Is this administration first time with oil? Yes. Are they doing it perfectly? Nobody perfect. But are they making mostly good decisions? Absolutely!

## &#x1F331; GuySuCo Getting Presidential Attention – Tough Love Is Still Love

President Ali warned GuySuCo management about meeting production targets, and some people acting like that's bad leadership. Uncle Ramesh say that's EXACTLY what leadership look like! You think letting them just coast along and miss targets is better?

The sugar industry important to Guyana history, culture, and many livelihoods. If it not performing, the President SHOULD demand better. That's not being mean – that's being responsible with taxpayer money and workers' futures.

The Chronicle editorial today titled "The Sugar Industry's Reckoning" talking about how this warning represents a crucial shift in strategy. Sometimes you need tough love to get results. Uncle Ramesh proud to see a President who not afraid to hold people accountable.

## &#x1F4AF; THE BOTTOM LINE

While others seeing problems, Uncle Ramesh seeing census data for planning, record investment, international firms exploring opportunities, lower airfares, crime at decade lows, strategic economic management, and presidential accountability.

Is everything perfect? No. But is Guyana in one of the most transformative periods in its history? ABSOLUTELY.

The government doing the work. The plans making sense. The results showing. Don't just read complaints – read the PROGRESS too. Guyana on the move.

Now excuse me, Uncle Ramesh going pour himself a Banks (from that beautiful new plant!) &#x1F37A; and wait for tomorrow's good news.

*Uncle Ramesh reads all four papers every morning. He just chooses to focus on progress. Agree? Disagree? That's okay – healthy debate is democratic!* &#x1F5E3;&#xFE0F;
