### 🚢 US MILITARY DESTROYING BOATS IN THE CARIBBEAN — AT LEAST 80 DEAD

The biggest story in the region remains the US military's ongoing operations near Venezuela. Since September, American forces have destroyed multiple vessels in international waters, killing at least 80 people in what Washington calls anti-drug-smuggling strikes. The most advanced US aircraft carrier is now stationed in the Caribbean Sea, with nearly a dozen Navy ships and 12,000 personnel deployed to the region.

US Senator Peter Welch has expressed alarm at the mobilisation of National Guard troops, warships, and fighter jets. The FAA temporarily closed airspace over much of the Caribbean on Saturday after a surprise strike, though flights resumed Sunday. For a region that depends on tourism and air travel, every airspace closure is a direct hit to the economy.

### 🇯🇲 JAMAICA GETS US$415M EMERGENCY IMF LOAN POST-HURRICANE MELISSA

The Caribbean Development Bank and IMF have approved Jamaica's request for approximately US$415 million in emergency financial assistance following Hurricane Melissa, which struck as a Category 5 storm in October 2025, killing at least 19 people. Jamaica's Ministry of Entertainment separately reported raising an estimated J$200 million from its 'I Love Jamaica' concert series to support recovery.

The island is still rebuilding. The money helps, but Category 5 scars take years to heal.

### 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD DEFENCE MINISTER: "OUR AIRSPACE IS FINE, STOP PANICKING"

Trinidad and Tobago's Defence Minister Wayne Sturge has dismissed social media claims that the country's airspace has been restricted, insisting all aviation operations remain "normal and fully functional." Meanwhile, T&T Prime Minister is set to address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid a multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge.

When the government has to publicly deny that the airspace is closed, the situation is already not normal. But sure — everything is fine.
