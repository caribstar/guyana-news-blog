## 🗳️ BARBADOS: Elections Set for February 11

**Prime Minister Mia Mottley** has called elections for February 11, 2026, seeking her THIRD consecutive term.

Here's the thing: Mottley's Barbados Labour Party won **30-0** in 2018. Then won **30-0 AGAIN** in 2022. That's every single seat. Twice.

| Election | BLP Seats | Opposition Seats |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| 2018 | 30 | 0 |
| 2022 | 30 | 0 |
| 2026 | ? | ? |

The question isn't whether Mottley will win — it's whether the Democratic Labour Party can win even ONE seat this time. 

Mottley has positioned herself as a global voice on climate change and debt restructuring. At home, she's pushing "Barbados 2.0" economic reforms. Love her or hate her, she's dominating.

## ✈️ US VISA: Birth Tourism Crackdown Hits Caribbean

The United States is tightening visa rules for pregnant travelers, and Caribbean nationals are feeling the squeeze.

**What's happening:** US consulates are now asking more questions about pregnancy status and due dates. Women in their third trimester may face additional scrutiny or denial.

**The concern:** "Birth tourism" — traveling to the US specifically to give birth so the child gets automatic US citizenship.

**Caribbean impact:** 
- More visa interviews asking about pregnancy
- Requests for return flight documentation
- Questions about medical insurance coverage

One Guyanese traveler reported: "They asked me why I wanted to see Disney World at 7 months pregnant. I just like Mickey Mouse!"

The State Department says they're not banning pregnant travelers — just ensuring visitors have "legitimate" tourism purposes. Uh huh.

## 💰 JAMAICA: IMF Back in the Picture

Jamaica is reportedly in discussions with the **International Monetary Fund** for additional financial assistance.

**The background:** Jamaica successfully completed its previous IMF program in 2019, reducing debt-to-GDP from over 140% to under 100%. It was hailed as a success story.

**The current situation:** Rising inflation, energy costs, and post-COVID recovery challenges have the government seeking additional support.

**PM Andrew Holness:** Emphasizing this is "precautionary" assistance, not emergency bailout.

Translation: "We're not broke, we're just... financially cautious."
