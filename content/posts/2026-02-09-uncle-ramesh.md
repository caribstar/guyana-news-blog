## 🏏 TWO GUYANESE BOYS JUST OWNED THE T20 WORLD CUP

Let me start where the Brief should have started — with PRIDE.

**Shimron Hetmyer**, born in Cumberland, Mahaica-Berbice, just broke Chris Gayle's record for the fastest West Indies fifty in T20 World Cup history. TWENTY-TWO BALLS. Six sixes. The man arrived in India hours before the match because of visa issues, and he STILL destroyed Scotland.

Then **Romario Shepherd**, from Lethem — LETHEM! Interior Guyana! — took FIVE wickets including a HAT-TRICK. Four wickets in five balls to end the match.

Two Guyanese men. On the world stage. Making the Caribbean proud.

And what does the Brief lead with? Christopher Ram complaining about the Auditor General. 🤦‍♂️

Nephew, you need to learn what matters. When your countrymen are smashing records at Eden Gardens, you CELEBRATE. The audit reports can wait until Monday afternoon.

## 🏟️ Bayroc Stadium: PROOF You Can Touch

The Brief mentions the stadium opening like it's a footnote. Let me tell you what this MEANS.

Linden has been asking for a proper sporting facility for DECADES. Every opposition leader promised. Every coalition budget talked about it. Nobody built it.

**This government BUILT IT.** President Ali went up there personally to open it. Linden now has a national-standard stadium. Young athletes from Region 10 no longer have to travel to Georgetown to compete.

This is what "Putting People First" looks like. Not a slogan. A stadium. Concrete and grass and lights.

| What They Promised | What This Government Did |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "Sports facilities coming" (every election) | Bayroc Stadium OPEN |
| "Youth development" (every budget) | Palmyra, McKenzie, New Amsterdam — all under construction |
| "Every region will benefit" | $6 BILLION for sports in 2026 alone |

## ⚡ Gas-to-Energy: Yes, It's Coming

The Brief loves to count deadlines. "Original deadline: long passed." Very clever. Very sarcastic.

Here's what they won't tell you: $258 billion has been invested. The Wales site is active. Prime Minister Phillips confirmed electricity by Q4 2026. The US EXIM Bank is backing $8.1 billion in financing — you think the Americans lend money to projects that aren't going to finish?

When this project delivers 50% cheaper electricity, I want every person who laughed at the deadlines to personally apologize. In writing. On nice stationery.

## 📋 On Christopher Ram

Christopher Ram is a chartered accountant who has been criticizing PPP/C governments since before some of you were born. He is brilliant, persistent, and absolutely allergic to saying anything positive about the administration.

Does the Auditor General need reform? Probably. Every institution does. But Ram's column is not NEWS. It's COMMENTARY from a known critic. The Brief treats it like a government scandal broke. It didn't. A columnist wrote a column. That's what columnists do.

When this same Auditor General was appointed under the coalition, Ram was quiet. Now he has concerns. Interesting timing.

## 🎓 Law School: A Vision Becoming Reality

Attorney General Nandlall announced the CLE law school will start construction this year at UG. Eight acres cleared. Budget allocated.

The Brief's response? "Means either groundbreaking in March or throw some cement at it in December."

The disrespect. This government is building Guyana's FIRST law school. Caribbean students will come HERE to study. Legal education will be accessible to ordinary Guyanese families. This is TRANSFORMATIONAL.

But sure, make a joke about cement. That's helpful.

---

## 🚢 On the Cubans

77 Cubans screened for trafficking is a serious matter that deserves serious coverage, not tabloid treatment. The government's security apparatus identified and screened these individuals — that's the system WORKING.

Cuba is in crisis because of US sanctions. People are desperate. The fact that Guyana's authorities caught this shows COMPETENCE, not failure.

## 🏠 On Circuitville

I notice the Brief didn't mention whether the structures were built legally on government land. I notice they didn't mention squatting. I notice they didn't check whether these families were offered relocation.

When you bulldoze only the headline and not the context, you can make anything look bad. A government that has delivered MORE house lots than any administration in history is not anti-housing. There's a reason they call it "land reclamation."

## 🏏 My Prediction

West Indies vs England, February 11. Hetmyer is going to bat at No. 3 again and he's going to TERRORIZE the English bowlers. Shepherd will take wickets. Windies will win.

You heard it from Ramesh first.
