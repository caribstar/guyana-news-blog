Good morning, Guyana! ☕

Welcome to Monday, where the Opposition Leader can't show up on time to his own extradition hearing, the government's office complex now costs more than some countries' GDP, and single mothers near a Chinese friendship park are being told to pack their bags. Happy Monday!

**Today's menu:** Azruddin gets an arrest warrant (briefly), the Haags Bosch money pit deepens, Schoonard residents face eviction, Dr. Frank Anthony can't catch a break, and the Manickchand/Region 10 drama continues to be absolutely hilarious.

## ⚖️ Azruddin Mohamed Shows Up Late, Gets Warrant, Gets Mercy

US-indicted businessman and Opposition Leader Azruddin Mohamed showed up **25 minutes late** to his extradition hearing on Monday morning. Magistrate Judy Latchman issued an arrest warrant at 9:05 AM when he failed to appear. His lawyers asked for five minutes. He didn't make that either.

When he finally arrived at 9:30, pushing past reporters, the Magistrate recalled the warrant but delivered a stern warning. Her exact words: **"I will temper justice with mercy."**

Translation: "You got lucky. Don't try it again."

| **Azruddin's Court Attendance Record** | **Status** |
|------|------|
| On time | ❌ |
| Within grace period | ❌ |
| Before warrant issued | ❌ |
| Before someone physically dragged him in | ✅ (barely) |

The matter was adjourned to February 18. His father Nazar is reportedly still unwell. The extradition proceedings continue their slow march toward... something.

## 🏢 Haags Bosch Office Complex Hits $19.6 Billion

Remember the new government office complex at Haags Bosch? The one that was going to be a symbol of modern governance? Well, it's now projected to cost **$19.6 billion**, with approximately $9.8 billion already spent.

That's BILLION. With a B. For an office building.

**The Haags Bosch Cost Tracker™:**

| **Year** | **Projected Cost** | **Reaction** |
|------|------|------|
| Initial | "Reasonable" | 😊 |
| Mid-construction | "A bit more than expected" | 😐 |
| Current | $19.6 BILLION | 😱 |
| Next year | ♾️ | 🤷 |

For context, $19.6 billion could fund about 980 years of Stabroek News operations. Just saying.

## 🏚️ Schoonard Single Mothers Given One Week to Relocate

Residents of Schoonard, West Bank Demerara — mostly single mothers living near the Guyana-China Friendship Park (Joe Vieira Park) — have been issued **eviction notices giving them one week to relocate** so the government can build a recreational park.

One week. Single mothers. For a park.

The irony of evicting vulnerable families from near a "Friendship Park" to build a recreational facility is the kind of thing that writes itself. We don't even need to add jokes.

## 💊 Dr. Frank Anthony vs. Everyone

Minister of Health Dr. Frank Anthony had a busy weekend defending himself on multiple fronts:

- The **Cuban medical programme** is in trouble as Cuba's economic crisis worsens. Anthony is taking heat for delays and broken promises.
- The **Paediatric and Maternal Hospital** construction has been delayed because the contractor (VAMED Engineering) changed ownership. The government is now negotiating with new management.
- Kaieteur News editorial flat out said Anthony is **"wasting time and reducing his standing before citizens"** over the medical pact situation.

**Dr. Anthony's Monday Stress Level:** 📈📈📈📈📈

## 🗣️ Manickchand on Region 10: "I Can't Beat Him"

Education Minister Priya Manickchand delivered the quote of the weekend when asked about the five-month leadership impasse in Region 10. Her response, roughly paraphrased: **"I have zero powers to instruct the person sitting next to me, to beat him, because it sounds like the member wants me to beat him, to do what she thinks he's supposed to do."**

Five months without regional leadership. The solution apparently involves physical violence that the Minister is constitutionally unable to authorize. Governance!

## 💉 HIV Infections Set to Fall

Some genuinely good health news: Guyana is projecting a decline in new HIV infections this year. Nearly 7,800 persons are on antiretroviral treatment with the majority achieving viral suppression. Prevention and transmission efforts have been strengthened.

## 🏗️ Quick Hits

- **OSH Advisory Council to be reconstituted** — Labour Minister Griffith admits it's been "inactive" but promises action by year end
- **Hybrid nursing programme to graduate 800** — major health workforce expansion coming
- **Global oil demand rising slower than expected** — IEA says surplus could hit 3.73 million bpd. Brent crude still below $70
- **Republic Bank launches $60M mortgages at 5%** — responding to Budget 2026 housing agenda
- **Finance Minister defends procurement system** — Dr. Singh says framework is "robust." Opposition says it's rubber-stamped. The usual.

That's your Monday. The Energy Conference starts tomorrow, Azruddin has court again on Wednesday, and the Haags Bosch complex will probably cost another billion by the time you finish reading this.

Stay alert, Guyana. 🇬🇾
