# CLE RAMESH'S HOT TAKE

**Tuesday, January 14, 2026**

---

*[Uncle Ramesh on his verandah, Tuesday morning, coffee in hand, reading The Brief with increasing exasperation]*

Alright, alright, ALRIGHT.

I just finish reading today's "Brief" and lemme tell you somethingâ€”these people making joke about EVERYTHING while the government actually FIXING the country!

##  LAW YEAR OPENING: NOT A JOKE

The Brief making fun of the AG pointing out magistrates not following the law? THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!

You know why Nandlall had to stand up there and REMIND people that plea-bargaining is MANDATORY? Because for YEARSâ€”under the previous governmentâ€”nobody enforced these modern laws! The legislation was passed but collecting dust!

**This is EXACTLY what reform looks like:**
- Identifying where system failing
- Calling it out publicly  
- Demanding accountability
- Following up with action

The Brief making jokes, saying "everyone remembered laws exist." No! The AG is doing his JOB by ensuring the judiciary IMPLEMENTS the laws Parliament passed!

And Chancellor George revealing they handled 30,000 criminal cases with staff shortages? That's TRANSPARENCY! That's asking for support! That's the judiciary saying "we need help" instead of hiding the problems!

**Reality Check for The Brief:** You can't fix problems you don't acknowledge. The 2026 Law Year opening was about HONEST ASSESSMENT, not ceremony!

## RE NOT A JOKE, PEOPLE

Ohhhhh, The Brief really showing their ignorance now.

Making fun of government apps? Let me EDUCATE you:

**Do you know what these apps represent?**

1. **Direct accountability** - You can now DOCUMENT your complaint with timestamp
2. **Transparency** - Everyone can see response times  
3. **Data collection** - Government can identify problem areas
4. **Accessibility** - No more driving to Georgetown to file complaint
5. **Modern governance** - What first-world countries been doing for DECADE

The Brief saying "What about government WiFi?" - THAT'S WHY THEY MAKING THE APPS! To work on YOUR phone with YOUR data!

Minister Manickchand being honest: "You get response in 24 hours but action may take longer." That's REALISTIC EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT! Better than promising magic and delivering nothing!

**The old system:** Call NDC. Maybe someone answer. Maybe they write it down. Maybe they remember. Maybe something happen.

**The new system:** App. Receipt. Tracking. Accountability. Follow-up.

But sure, make jokes. Stay in 1990s while government trying to bring country to 2026.

##  TO HIGHWAYS: RESPECTING THE ENGINEERING

The Brief really showed their backside here.

Making fun of President Ali for pointing out they draining swamps to build highways? You think that EASY?

Let me break it down for the smart people making jokes:

**Building roads in Guyana involves:**
- Dealing with water table issues
- Installing MASSIVE drainage systems
- Soil stabilization (you can't just pour asphalt on swamp!)
- Environmental management
- Coordinating multiple contractors
- Managing logistics in challenging terrain

When President said "This shows full understanding of development and urban planning," he's RIGHT! Because they PLANNING FOR DRAINAGE before building, not after!

You know what happens when you build without proper drainage? Look at some roads in Georgetown that flood every rain!

**And about the Linden-Mabura road being delayed?**

The Brief joking "add 6 months to every deadline" - but they not mentioning:
- UK (the FUNDER) confirmed December 2025 was unrealistic
- Project is 62% complete (that's MORE than half!)
- Contractors doing 7km of paving PER MONTH
- New realistic target is September 2026

Would you rather:
- Government lie and say "almost done" when it not?
- Or government give HONEST UPDATES with REAL TIMELINES?

The Ali government chose transparency. But The Brief prefer jokes.

## âš¡ GAS-TO-ENERGY: THE BRIEF DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS

This one REALLY burn me up.

The Brief asking "Why not solar?" and throwing around numbers like they know something.

Let me educate these comedians:

**Why Gas-to-Energy makes sense:**

1. **Base Load Power** - Solar only works when sun shining! Gas provides 24/7 RELIABLE power
2. **We HAVE the gas** - It's OUR resource, coming up with oil anyway. Use it or waste it!
3. **Job Creation** - Long-term technical jobs, not just installation
4. **Energy Security** - Not dependent on imported solar panels
5. **Grid Stability** - Consistent output, not weather-dependent
6. **Cost Certainty** - We control the supply, not subject to global solar panel prices

**The Brief's solar comparison is MISLEADING:**
- Argentina project had Chinese financing (different terms)
- Philippines has different labor costs  
- Wisconsin? They comparing TROPICAL GUYANA to WISCONSIN?
- None of these countries had FREE NATURAL GAS coming out the ground!

**The real question:** Why would we NOT use our own natural resource when we can combine it with renewables LATER?

The Skeldon Sugar Factory failed because of MIS-MANAGEMENT, not because using local resources is wrong!

The Brief making false equivalencies and calling them "uncomfortable questions." Noâ€”they just asking UNINFORMED questions!

## : GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT DUE

The Brief mocking Dr. Singh for saying population growth "vindicates government policy."

But IS HE WRONG?

**Facts:**
- Under previous government: MASS EMIGRATION
- Under current government: People STAYING and RETURNING
- Oil money ALONE doesn't make country livable (look at some oil-rich countries!)
- Government invested in: healthcare, education, infrastructure, jobs

You think people just having more children for no reason? Or remigrating because weather nice?

**NO!**

People staying because:
- Economic opportunities
- Better healthcare
- Infrastructure improving
- Government creating environment for growth

But The Brief want to credit "biology" for population growth? 

Stupidness!

If conditions were TERRIBLE, people would STILL be leaving regardless of oil money! Look at Venezuelaâ€”they have oil and people FLEEING!

The government creating CONDITIONS for growth. The census PROVES IT. But The Brief too busy making jokes to acknowledge SUCCESS.

## âš–ï¸ THE MOHAMEDS: INTERESTING HOW THE BRIEF REPORTS THIS

"Still here, still fighting" - Real cute.

But notice The Brief suddenly not making jokes here? Because the truth is:
- People showed up to court  
- Court system working
- Due process being followed
- Nobody being persecuted

If this was REAL persecution, would they be getting warrants withdrawn? Would their LAWYER be able to request adjournments?

The Brief making light of it, but the FACTS show fair treatment!

## : EVEN THE BRIEF CAN'T RUIN THIS

For once, The Brief right: Our women's cricket team is EXCELLENT and needs no satire!

Seven-run victory defending 96 runs? That's GUYANESE EXCELLENCE in action!

See? When you SUPPORT instead of MOCK, results speak for themselves!

---

## RAMESH'S FINAL WORD

Today's Brief showed something important: **They don't understand the difference between progress and perfection.**

**Yes:**
- Apps might crash (then we fix them!)
- Laws were being ignored (now being enforced!)
- Roads take longer than planned (but they GETTING BUILT!)
- Projects cost money (but creating VALUE!)

**This is called DEVELOPMENT!**

You can't joke your way to progress. You can't satirize roads into existence. You can't mock apps into working better.

The government is DOING THE WORK. The Brief is making JOKES.

**Ask yourself:** Who contributing more to Guyana's future?

The people building infrastructure, creating accountability systems, enforcing laws, and being transparent about challenges?

Or the people making cute jokes from the sidelines?

I know my answer.

## AL NUMBERS

**What The Brief Called "White Elephants":** Actually functioning infrastructure  
**What The Brief Called "Slow Progress":** Realistic timelines with transparency  
**What The Brief Called "Questionable":** Strategic use of natural resources  
**What The Brief Called "Spin":** Accurate assessment of census data

*Uncle Ramesh puts down his paper, shaking his head*

These young people think cynicism is intelligence.

I call it LAZINESS.

Until tomorrow, when I educate them again.

**Stay informed. Stay supportive. Stay REALISTIC.**

---

**Uncle Ramesh** - *Your diaspora uncle who actually understands development doesn't happen overnight, and apps are better than the old "hope somebody remembers your complaint" system.*
