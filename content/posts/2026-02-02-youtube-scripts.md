**[TITLE CARD: THE GUYANA BRIEF — Feb 2, 2026]**

**[AVATAR ON SCREEN]**

"Good morning Guyana! Here's your 60-second Monday news roundup!

Two MASSIVE things happening today. Budget 2026 debate opens in the National Assembly — that's one point five five eight TRILLION dollars on the table. Education getting 183 billion, healthcare 161 billion, and 40,000 new homes in the pipeline.

At the same time, the Acting Chief Justice is expected to rule on the Mohameds extradition challenge. Azruddin Mohamed — the elected Opposition Leader — is fighting to stay in Guyana while the US wants him extradited. Today we find out what the court says.

Over the weekend, the brand new Plaza Court Hotel opened on Main Street Georgetown — 60 rooms, international standard. And the government announced 120 million dollars for Mashramani 2026, the biggest investment ever in the festival.

Regionally, Barbados elections are nine days away — Mottley going for a THIRD straight 30-0 sweep. And Trinidad is dealing with a police shooting scandal after CCTV showed officers firing on a man with his hands up.

That's your Monday brief! Full breakdown on guyanadailybrief.com. Stay informed, Guyana!"

**[TITLE CARD: THE GUYANA BRIEF — FULL BREAKDOWN — Feb 2, 2026]**

**[AVATAR ON SCREEN]**

"What's happening everybody! Welcome to The Guyana Brief for Monday, February 2nd, 2026. Big, big day for Guyana. Let's get into it.

**[SEGMENT 1: BUDGET DEBATE]**

First up — Budget 2026 debate officially opens today in the National Assembly. This is a one point five five eight TRILLION dollar budget — a 307% increase from 2021. Finance Minister Ashni Singh says it's all about putting people first.

The highlights? 183 billion for education, including the Guyana Digital School with 22,000 students already signed up. 161 billion for healthcare — we're training 162 specialist doctors and over 5,000 nurses. 159 billion for housing, with 40,000 new homes promised. And every adult 18 and over getting that $100,000 cash grant.

Now, the opposition is calling this reckless spending. The government says it's nation-building. Expect fireworks in the Assembly today — both sides have a LOT to say.

**[SEGMENT 2: MOHAMEDS RULING]**

Also happening TODAY — the Acting Chief Justice is expected to rule on the Mohameds extradition case. Gold traders Azruddin and Nazar Mohamed are challenging the entire extradition process, saying the Home Affairs Minister's decision was unlawful and biased.

Remember, Azruddin Mohamed is the elected Leader of the Opposition. The government has been accused of delaying Parliament sittings hoping an extradition order comes through first. The prosecution even tried to rush the hearing to an earlier date. Whatever the ruling is today, it's going to have massive political implications.

**[SEGMENT 3: DEVELOPMENT NEWS]**

On the development front — the Plaza Court Hotel opened on Main Street Georgetown this weekend. Sixty rooms, modern design, international standards. President Ali was at the ribbon cutting. Guyana hit 453,000 visitors last year, so we need every hotel room we can get.

Plus, the government is investing over 120 million dollars in Mashramani 2026 — the biggest Mash investment ever. It's Guyana's 60th Independence anniversary, so expect costumes, music, and celebrations like never before.

The UK partnership also got stronger — Deputy PM David Lammy came to Georgetown and signed onto the Global Biodiversity Alliance. The world is watching Guyana, and they're impressed.

**[SEGMENT 4: CARIBBEAN ROUNDUP]**

Quick Caribbean roundup! Barbados goes to the polls on February 11 — that's nine days away. PM Mia Mottley is going for a THIRD consecutive term. The DLP hasn't won a single seat in two elections. Can they break the streak? Most analysts say no.

In Trinidad, there's massive outrage after CCTV footage showed police shooting a man who appeared to have his hands in the air. The Law Association is questioning the police commissioner's decision not to suspend the officers. This is the fourth police killing in Trinidad for 2026.

And cricket fans — West Indies vs Afghanistan T20 series starts in Dubai as warmup for the T20 World Cup on February 7th!

**[CLOSING]**

That's your Monday brief, Guyana! Budget debate, court rulings, new hotels, and Mash season. Subscribe and share with your people — let's keep everybody informed.

Until next time — one Guyana, one love! Stay blessed!"
