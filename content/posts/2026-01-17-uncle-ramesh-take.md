*Uncle Ramesh's Response from Queens, NY — Saturday, January 17, 2026*

---

Eh eh! The Daily Brief wake up this morning and choose negativity AGAIN! Every single day is the same thing — government build something, they complain. Government fix something, they complain. Government breathe, they complain!

But me ain't going let them bring down the good vibes on this beautiful Saturday. Let Uncle Ramesh set the record straight for the diaspora who want FACTS, not fiction!

## ☀️ SOLAR FARM SUCCESS — BUT BRIEF STILL FINDING PROBLEMS!

The government just commissioned a **US$8.14 MILLION** solar farm at Charity that will benefit over 3,500 households, save **GY$267 million per year** in fuel costs, and offset 3,500 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually.

This is FIFTH solar farm under the GUYSOL programme! FIFTH! In less than three months!

**Total investment: US$83.3 MILLION** in renewable energy!

And what the Daily Brief have to say? *"BUT BUT BUT blackouts still happening!"*

Yuh see how these people does operate? The government literally building the solution, step by step, systematically bringing renewable energy online, and them still finding something negative to say.

<div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">

**Let Me Break It Down For You:**

| What Government Doing | What Brief Ignoring |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 18 MWp solar capacity now online | This takes TIME to build |
| 33 MWp total coming by end of programme | Rome wasn't built in a day |
| Gas-to-Energy project progressing | 300 MW coming end of 2026 |
| Amaila Falls Hydro still on agenda | Long-term vision, people! |

</div>

By end of 2026, Guyana will have **300 megawatts from gas** plus all this solar capacity. But them want miracle overnight? Building energy infrastructure for a developing nation takes YEARS of planning and execution!

The PPP/C government doing what no other government did — actually INVESTING in energy solutions instead of just talking!

## 🔫 SECURITY ISSUE? GOVERNMENT AND POLICE ACTING SWIFTLY!

Now, about this security company with the airsoft guns — yes, it's a problem. Nobody disputing that.

**BUT LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED:**

✅ Police conducted **intelligence-led operation**
✅ Arrests were made **immediately**
✅ Owner of company in custody
✅ Investigation ongoing
✅ Public informed promptly

This is how a functioning government works! When problems arise, you ADDRESS them! You investigate, you arrest, you prosecute!

The Daily Brief making it sound like government responsible for what private companies do behind closed doors. Should President Ali personally inspect every security guard holster? Should Brigadier Phillips stand outside every supermarket checking firearms?

The police did their job. The system worked. Criminals got caught.

**NEXT!**

## 🏦 PRIVATE BANKING — ECONOMIC SOPHISTICATION!

Oh, so now GBTI launching private banking services is a problem too?

Let me explain something to the people who never left Guyana: In EVERY developed economy, banks offer different levels of service. When your economy grows, your financial sector MUST grow with it.

President Ali said it perfectly: *"Private banking is not about stratifying customers or exclusion, it is about meeting different demands in a more sophisticated economy."*

Guyana GDP growing at **14% annually**! We have new investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses that need specialized financial services. This is a SIGN OF PROGRESS!

But nah, the Daily Brief want to make jokes. *"Special bank for rich people!"* 

You know what happen when rich people and investors CAN'T get proper banking services? **THEY TAKE THEIR MONEY ELSEWHERE!**

The Brief complaining about brain drain but then mock the services that keep successful Guyanese investing at home. Make it make sense!

---

## 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE MOVING — STOP THE AMNESIA!

The Campbellville Polyclinic — **$831 million** investment in healthcare! Taking shape! Going to serve THOUSANDS of Guyanese!

And what the Brief do? Immediately pivot to *"but what about the Day and Night Care Facility?"*

Let me address this directly: Minister Vindhya Persaud already explained that facility opening "cannot be rushed." There's proper procedures, staffing, licensing — these things take time!

The opposition (specifically WIN party) running around taking photos of grass growing on fences and calling it "election gimmick." These are the same people who couldn't build a outhouse in their 23 years of coalition governments!

Now they experts on facility commissioning timelines?

## 🏏 CRICKET: WE'RE STILL DEFENDING CHAMPIONS!

Guyana Women lost ONE match by 7 runs and suddenly the sky falling?

Let me remind everyone:

🏆 **GUYANA ARE THE DEFENDING T20 BLAZE CHAMPIONS**

🏆 Won the title last year after going UNDEFEATED

🏆 Won Round 1 against Windward Islands

One bad game against Leeward Islands (who are actually playing well this tournament) and people panicking?

Tonight we face Jamaica at 7 PM. Jamaica lost BOTH their matches. Our spinners Ashmini Munisar and Plaffianna Millington have been DOMINANT. 

Captain Shemaine Campbelle knows what it takes to win. This team has championship DNA.

**My Prediction:** Guyana by 25+ runs. Book it!

## 🎤 UNCLE RAMESH FINAL WORD

From my apartment here in Queens, looking at the snow outside, I thank God every day that Guyana is in capable hands.

Is everything perfect? No. Does everything happen overnight? No. 

But compare where we at today versus 2015-2020 under the coalition. Compare the investment, the infrastructure, the vision, the execution.

The Daily Brief can keep making jokes. The people on the ground SEEING the changes. The diaspora SEEING the transformation.

When I go home this Mashramani, I'll be driving on new roads, seeing new buildings, and celebrating with my people. That's what matters.

**To the Guyana Women's team:** Go out there tonight and make us proud! 🏏

**To President Ali and the PPP/C:** Keep building, keep investing, keep ignoring the haters!

**To my fellow Guyanese in the diaspora:** Send home that barrel, call your family, and remember — Guyana on the rise!
