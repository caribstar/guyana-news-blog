## 💸 CASH GRANTS: "NOT SUSTAINABLE" — PRESIDENT

**What Happened:** President Ali declared that future cash grants are "not sustainable," warning that "some people would use this as a political opportunity."

**The Backstory:** Just one year ago, the government was "committed to making future cash grants." What a difference 365 days makes!

**The Math:**
- 2025: "We are committed to future cash grants!"
- 2026: "Cash grants are not sustainable."
- Also 2026: Oil production approaching 1 million barrels per day.

**Dem Boys Seh:** "When election coming, cash grant sustainable. When election done, cash grant unsustainable. Is like magic — de money just disappear!"

## 🗑️ GEORGETOWN: MINISTER SAYS "UNACCEPTABLE," CITY HALL SAYS "WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU"

**What Happened:** Local Government Minister Priya Manickchand held an emergency virtual meeting with Mayor Alfred Mentore over the "unacceptable" state of Georgetown. The city was given until 11 AM Monday to present a cleanup plan.

**The Quote:** "Sanitation services, solid waste disposal, garbage collection etc must be reliable, predictable and effective. Or they are wasting time."

**Translation:** Georgetown smells like a combination of stagnant drain water, burning garbage, and broken promises.

**Current Status of Georgetown:**
- ☐ Clean
- ☐ Habitable
- ☑️ A talking point for politicians

**Dem Boys Seh:** "City Hall got till 11 AM to fix Georgetown. De garbage pile got till noon to laugh."

## 👩‍🏫 TEACHERS UNION: "WE'VE BEEN WRITING LETTERS, NOBODY ANSWERING"

**What Happened:** GTU President Coretta McDonald says the Education Ministry is delaying a crucial meeting on teacher promotions. Teachers haven't been promoted in three years, and many are retiring without the positions they deserved.

**The Problem:** The Teaching Service Commission was reconstituted without an Opposition Leader in place — which the GTU says is "a direct ploy by the government."

**Ministry's Apparent Strategy:**
1. Receive letter requesting meeting
2. Look at letter
3. Put letter in drawer
4. Repeat

**McDonald's Assessment:** "The longer the ministry delays the meeting with the GTU, our teachers are going to be in jeopardy again."

**Dem Boys Seh:** "Teacher write letter to Ministry. Ministry write letter to TSC. TSC write letter to President. President write letter to 2027."

## 🏫 HINTERLAND SCHOOLS: "FAR FROM OPERATIONAL READINESS" — OPPOSITION

**What Happened:** Opposition MP Sherod Duncan visited two school construction sites in Region Nine — the $215 million Nappi Secondary School and the $182 million Tabatinga Secondary School — and reported concerns about progress.

**Duncan's Finding:** The schools are "far from operational readiness."

**Government's Likely Response:** "The projects are 90% complete and on track for completion soon."

**The Eternal Guyanese Infrastructure Formula:**
- Announced: 100% enthusiasm
- Groundbreaking: 100% ribbon
- Completion: 90% (forever)

## ⛽ GAS-TO-ENERGY: CONTROL ROOMS ARRIVE AT WALES

**What Happened:** Control rooms for the Gas-to-Energy project were transported to the Wales site on Saturday evening, marking "another key milestone."

**Translation:** Big boxes arrived. Milestone achieved.

**Project Status Update:**
- ✅ Boxes delivered
- ✅ Photos taken
- ✅ Press release issued
- ⏳ Actual gas flowing: End of 2026 (we think)

**Dem Boys Seh:** "Control room reach Wales. Now we just need de gas, de pipes, de turbines, de transmission lines, and de prayers."

## 🏥 HOSPITAL TRAGEDY: GPHC LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION

**What Happened:** A 22-year-old pregnant woman died after jumping from the third-floor window of the female medical ward at Georgetown Public Hospital on Sunday evening. The hospital has launched an internal investigation.

**The Questions:** Family members are asking how a patient "displaying clear psychological distress" was able to leave her bed unaccompanied and access a window.

**GPHC Statement:** The hospital says a psychiatric evaluation was conducted and "no psychotic symptoms or suicidal thoughts" were identified.

**If You Need Help:** The Mental Health Unit's Suicide Prevention Hotline is **915**. A mental health emergency is a real emergency.

## 🌊 NEW PASSENGER VESSEL: "SOON TO BE RENAMED"

**Highlights:**

## 🗳️ OPPOSITION LEADER: STILL LOADING...

**What Happened:** Letters to the editor are now asking the Speaker of the National Assembly to explain why he hasn't convened the meeting to elect an Opposition Leader — over 3 months after elections.

**Government's Position:** "We have no role in this."

**Speaker's Position:** *[No comment available]*

**Constitutional Position:** Article 184 says the Speaker must convene the meeting.

**Actual Position:** 🤷

**Dem Boys Seh:** "Opposition Leader seat so empty, spider done build house inside."

## 📊 INFLATION: THE NUMBERS VS THE VIBES

**What Happened:** A Stabroek News letter writer pointed out that official CPI data claims housing costs *decreased* by 1% since 2020.

**The Official Numbers:**
- Housing: -1.0%
- Food: +50.7%
- Transportation: +3.3%

**The Reality:** Try renting an apartment in Georgetown for 2020 prices. Go ahead. We'll wait.

**Bonus:** The New Guyana Marketing Corporation has stopped publishing market prices. No data, no problem!

**Dem Boys Seh:** "According to government, everything cheap. According to market, everything expensive. According to we pocket, nothing deh inside."
