# About The Daily Laugh 🇬🇾

Welcome to **The Daily Laugh** - your daily satirical roundup of Guyana's four major newspapers.

## What We Do

We read Stabroek News, Kaieteur News, Chronicle, and Guyana Times every day, then write funny commentary about the headlines. We're not real journalists - we're satirists who care about Guyana enough to mock its problems.

## Meet CARIBSTAR

Your editor and chief troublemaker. Strong opinions, questionable judgment, excellent coffee tolerance.
