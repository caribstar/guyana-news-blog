## Budget 2026 Estimates: Committee of Supply Update

The Committee of Supply continues consideration of the $1.558 trillion national budget. Key allocations examined this week:

- **Ministry of Labour and Manpower Planning:** $1.7 billion approved by the House
- **Ministry of Foreign Affairs:** $269 million for advocacy services, including payments to US lobby firms totaling US$90,000/month
- **President's Youth Advisory Council:** $75 million allocated, opposition questions performance measures
- **First Lady's Office:** $50 million allocated, with plans to raise additional $35 million through fundraising
- **Guyana Technical Training College:** $78 million budgeted for establishment

The budget debate phase has concluded. The Committee of Supply phase is where line-by-line examination occurs, producing the detailed spending revelations that the debate phase typically lacks.

## Infrastructure: Berbice Bridge Acquisition

Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill confirmed the government is finalising the process for full acquisition of the Berbice Bridge. The bridge, currently operating under a public-private partnership model, has been a source of public frustration over toll increases. Full government ownership would give the state direct control over toll policy and maintenance.

## Gold Sector: Mercury Reduction & Branding

Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat announced plans to reduce mercury use in gold mining, brand Guyana's gold for international markets, and support small miners in 2026. The initiatives come as the gold and bauxite mining sub-sectors are projected to expand by 5.4% and 19.3% respectively this year.

The announcements gain additional significance in the context of the Mohamed's Enterprise allegations — the OFAC sanctions specifically cited gold export fraud and tax evasion. Cleaning up the gold sector's reputation is both an environmental and an integrity issue.

## Sugar: GuySuCo Targets 100,000 Tonnes

Agriculture Minister Zulfikar Mustapha says GuySuCo is projecting 100,000 tonnes of sugar production in 2026, with 81% of the corporation's $8.4 billion budget allocation going to operations. The five-year plan targets profitability by 2030.

## Digital Government: GPF Goes Digital

President Ali announced plans for a full digital overhaul of the Guyana Police Force at the Annual Police Officers' Conference, including restructuring of human resources and police communications systems. The modernisation push follows concerns about record-keeping and institutional capacity.

## Health: Chikungunya Warning

Chikungunya cases are increasing across the Caribbean and the Americas. The mosquito-borne illness causes fever, joint pain, and rash. Health authorities are urging standard prevention measures: eliminating standing water, using repellent, and wearing protective clothing.

## Investment: GO-Invest Reports $157B In New Projects

The Guyana Office for Investment facilitated GY$157 billion in new projects in 2025. The figure reflects continued foreign and domestic investment confidence, driven primarily by the oil and gas sector's expansion.

## Regional Security: Brazil Border Patrols

Guyana has approached Brazil's Roraima State to jointly patrol the shared border. The initiative addresses cross-border security concerns in the mining regions and reflects growing bilateral cooperation between Georgetown and Brasilia.
