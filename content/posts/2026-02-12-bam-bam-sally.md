Chile, CHILE. Bam-Bam Sally ain't sleep since yesterday and I ain't plan to sleep tonight neither because this SOCU business got Georgetown buzzing like Stabroek Market on a Saturday morning.

## Rumor #1: Freedom House Got Very Busy Last Night

Now Sally ain't saying and Sally ain't implying, but a VERY reliable source — and by reliable I mean she does sell doubles right across the road from Freedom House — tell me that some VERY interesting activity was happening at PPP headquarters last night. Vehicles pulling up. Papers moving. People looking nervous.

Could be routine party business. Could be budget preparation. Could be spring cleaning. But the timing? *Chef's kiss.* The same day Mohamed tell the whole country "go search Freedom House for the hundreds of millions I give them"? What a coincidence.

Sally rating this one: **🌶️🌶️🌶️ Three Peppers** (Hot but unconfirmed)

## Rumor #2: The Third Lobby Firm

Foreign Minister Todd said they have THREE lobbying consultancies but only TWO are active. So who is the third one? And why they stop? Sally hearing whispers that the third firm was quietly dropped after questions started circulating about **who exactly** they were lobbying for and **what exactly** they were advocating.

One source in the foreign affairs ministry — and by source I mean a man who does clean the office and hear everything — say the third firm bill was much higher than the other two combined.

Sally rating this one: **🌶️🌶️ Two Peppers** (Warm and plausible)

## Rumor #3: The SOCU Sniffer Dog Found Nothing

Multiple people at the scene say the SOCU sniffer dog walked through the entire building and didn't alert to anything. Not drugs. Not large amounts of cash. Not gold. The dog essentially had a pleasant walk through an empty building and went home.

SOCU says they found "evidence of illegal financial operations." Mohamed says they found less than $2 million — money used to help the poor in the neighbourhood.

The dog has not issued a statement.

Sally rating this one: **🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ Four Peppers** (Multiple eyewitness sources)

## Rumor #4: Budget Estimates Getting Spicy

Word on the ground is that the upcoming estimates sessions are going to get even MORE uncomfortable for government ministers. Apparently certain opposition MPs — from both WIN and the other parties — have done proper research this time and have specific questions about specific contracts that certain ministers would rather not answer.

One MP allegedly told a colleague: "I got receipts."

Given that Mohamed already dropped the bankrolling bomb, and now lobby firm payments are public... the estimates sessions might be must-see television.

Sally rating this one: **🌶️🌶️🌶️ Three Peppers** (Very credible)

*Bam-Bam Sally's Rumor Mill is entertainment and street-level gossip. Don't quote Sally in Parliament. Don't quote Sally in court. And definitely don't quote Sally to your mother.*
