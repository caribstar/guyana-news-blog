## 🚢 US DRUG BOAT STRIKES: 133 AND COUNTING

The US military struck another vessel in the Caribbean on February 13, killing three people. That brings the total death toll to at least 133 people in 38+ strikes since September 2025.

Key developments:

- **Barbados FM Kerrie Symmonds** publicly expressed concern that the strikes "may have bypassed due process and risk setting a dangerous precedent"
- **US Senator Jack Reed** condemned the strikes
- **Amnesty International** warned any congressional authorization would "violate international human rights law"
- Defence Secretary Hegseth claimed "some top cartel drug-traffickers have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY" — but provided zero evidence

The strikes began in September 2025, escalated through the capture of Venezuela's Maduro in January, and continue without independent verification of who's actually being killed. Families of victims say many were civilians — primarily fishermen.

## 🇮🇷 IRAN-US NUCLEAR TALKS: PROGRESS IN GENEVA

The second round of Iran-US nuclear negotiations wrapped up today in Geneva with surprising optimism:

- Iran's FM Araghchi says an understanding on "main principles" has been reached
- He called them "very serious discussions" and said "the path for a deal has started"
- Trump says he'll be "indirectly involved" and hopes Iran will be "more reasonable"
- Witkoff and Kushner representing the US; Oman mediating

The backdrop is intense: two US aircraft carriers in the Middle East, Iran running military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, and 7,000+ killed in Iran's crackdown on protests. Russia-Ukraine envoy talks also happening in Geneva this week.

**Caribbean angle:** Any escalation could spike oil prices — good for Guyana and Trinidad's revenues, bad for every other island's import bill.

## 🇧🇧 BARBADOS: MOTTLEY PUSHES ELECTORAL REFORM

Fresh off her historic third consecutive election victory, PM Mia Mottley is calling for urgent electoral reform in Barbados. Caribbean leaders including PMs Drew (St Kitts), Skerrit (Dominica), and Holness (Jamaica) have congratulated her.

Meanwhile, a Stabroek News column examined Caribbean sovereignty in the Trump era, noting that Caribbean leaders are "simply being realistic" about their limited power when dealing with the US — from Trinidad being used as a staging ground, to St Lucia's students being banned from studying medicine in Cuba.

## 🇯🇲 JAMAICA: STUDENTS STRANDED IN CUBA

The Jamaican government is "considering what support could be provided" to Jamaican students in Cuba whose studies are being disrupted. The issue stems from US restrictions on Cuba that are rippling across the Caribbean, affecting education agreements that have been in place for decades.

In other Jamaica news, the JLP under Holness won its third consecutive term in September's elections, making him the party's first leader to achieve that feat.

## 🇹🇹 TRINIDAD: ENERGY WEEK & US ALLIANCE

Trinidad PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar will address Caribbean Energy Week 2026 amid what's being described as a "multi-billion-dollar energy investment surge." Trinidad also received licences from the US for oil and gas activities in Venezuela — a significant development showing continued US-Trinidad energy cooperation.

Meanwhile, the US reaffirmed its partnership with Persad-Bissessar's government as tensions over the Caribbean military operations continue.

## ✈️ AER LINGUS: FIRST DIRECT IRELAND-CARIBBEAN FLIGHTS

Aer Lingus has launched Ireland's first direct Caribbean service to Barbados — a significant shift for Irish travellers who previously had to transit through London or North America. The route follows the airline's planned cessation of Manchester transatlantic flights in March 2026. Barbados serves as a connectivity hub to other islands including St Lucia, Grenada, Antigua, and Trinidad.
