*A Pro-Government Perspective from Queens, NY* 🗽🇬🇾

---

## Nephew and Niece Dem,

Happy Friday from Queens! And before anybody start — yes, I read de news about Stabroek News closing. I getting to dat. But FIRST let me talk about what de Brief CONVENIENTLY buried under all de drama.

---

## 🏠 $150 BILLION FOR HOUSING! $150 BILLION!

Beta, Minister Croal announce **ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS** fuh housing in 2026. New housing schemes. Land acquisition. Utilities infrastructure. Regularisation of informal settlements.

De man say — and dis is a direct quote — "There must be no one living in any area for which you do not have the opportunity for ownership."

DAT IS GOVERNANCE! Dat is a government saying EVERY Guyanese deserve to own land. EVERY Guyanese deserve a proper house. And dey BACKING IT UP with $150 billion!

But what de Brief want to focus on? Rain.

## 🌊 On De Flooding

Yes, it rain. Yes, water accumulate. You know what ELSE happen? THREE MINISTERS went to the field — Mustapha, Edghill, and Croal — PERSONALLY inspecting drainage infrastructure. Pumps was activated. Sluices opened. Blockages cleared.

De Chronicle report it right: "Drainage systems stand firm amid intense rainfall."

In 96.7mm of rainfall — dat is NEARLY FOUR INCHES in a few hours, beta — de drainage infrastructure HELD. Water recede. Systems work. Ministers respond.

But de Brief want to make joke. "Maybe somebody should check if de pumps activated BEFORE de ministers show up fuh photos." 

BEFORE dis government, dem pumps WASN'T EVEN WORKING! Dem sluice gates was RUSTED SHUT! De NDIA was a GHOST ORGANIZATION!

Now yuh have ministers IN DE FIELD, pumps OPERATING, and water RECEDING — and yuh still complaining? Dis is why we can't have nice things!

## 📰 On Stabroek News Closing

Now. De big story.

Stabroek News closing after 39 years. And yes — it sad. Any newspaper closing is sad fuh democracy. Uncle Ramesh not gon pretend otherwise.

BUT — and de Brief won't tell you dis — Stabroek News close because of FACEBOOK and TIKTOK and YOUTUBE. Not because of de government. Not because of persecution. Because of MARKET FORCES.

De chairman HIMSELF say it: print advertising collapse 75% worldwide. Two thousand newspapers close in America alone! THREE HUNDRED in England!

So when certain people try to spin dis as "PPP killing press freedom" — NOPE. De PPP ain't kill Stabroek News. Mark Zuckerberg kill Stabroek News. 

And you know what? De government NEVER shut down a newspaper. Not ONE. Even Kaieteur — which attack dem EVERY SINGLE DAY — still printing! Freddie Kissoon write a whole column TODAY comparing Netanyahu to Hitler and NOBODY touch him!

THAT IS PRESS FREEDOM, BETA!

---

## 🎬 On Mohamed

SOCU release MORE video. MORE evidence. Mohamed enterprise was operating an ILLEGAL cambio — licence REVOKED — and dey catch it on camera.

De man response? "Is political persecution because of my speech."

Beta, de US indictment is from 2017 to 2024. De speech was LAST FRIDAY. De math ain't mathing!

---

## 🚀 ROCKETS FROM GUIANA!

De Brief mention it but didn't make a big deal — ROCKETS are launching from French Guiana! De Ariane 64 heavy rocket send 32 Amazon satellites into space FROM OUR REGION!

Dis is what progress look like! De Guiana coast — OUR COAST — is part of de space economy! And back home, we building highways, bridges, hospitals, and housing at a pace dis country NEVER see before.

But sure, let we focus on four hours of rain.

---

## 🎓 FREE UNIVERSITY UPDATE

16,000 applications since free tertiary education start! A NEW pre-medical programme with 210 students already enrolled! UG expanding hybrid learning across ALL regions!

De Minister say dey doing a rapid assessment to align training with de economy. Dat mean: we not just giving free education, we making sure de education MATCH de jobs.

DIS. IS. GOVERNANCE.
