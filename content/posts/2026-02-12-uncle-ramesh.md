Alright, alright, alright. Leh me understand this properly.

A man who is **sanctioned by the United States Treasury**. A man who is **indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on 11 counts**. A man whose family is accused of evading **US$50 million in gold export taxes**. A man who is literally facing **extradition proceedings** in Georgetown court right now.

And when SOCU searches his premises based on credible intelligence... that is political victimisation?

## Facts Are Facts

The US Department of Treasury sanctioned Azruddin Mohamed, Nazar Mohamed, and Mohamed's Enterprise in June 2024 under the Global Magnitsky Act. This is not the PPP doing this. This is the **United States government** saying these people engaged in corruption, bribery, and tax evasion.

The 25-page federal indictment alleges Mohamed's Enterprise omitted more than **10,000 kilograms of gold** from import and export declarations. That is TEN THOUSAND KILOGRAMS. And avoided paying more than **$50 million in duty taxes**.

So when SOCU gets intelligence that illegal financial activities may be taking place at a premises connected to these individuals, what exactly should they do? Send a polite letter?

## The Bankrolling Claims

Now, regarding this business about bankrolling the PPP. If Mohamed gave hundreds of millions to the PPP, that is between Mohamed and the PPP. Political donations are a normal part of democracy everywhere in the world.

But here is what Mohamed is NOT telling you: wealthy businessmen fund political parties because they expect **favourable treatment in return**. The OFAC sanctions document specifically states that Mohamed's Enterprise "engaged in extensive bribery schemes involving government officials."

So which is it? Did he fund the PPP out of patriotism? Or was he buying protection for his gold smuggling operation? The US government has already answered that question.

## The Lobby Firms

As for the US$90,000 per month for lobby firms — every developing country with significant foreign policy interests retains advocacy firms in Washington and other capitals. This is standard international practice. Minister Todd explained this clearly. Trinidad does it. Jamaica does it. Even tiny island states do it.

Guyana has a border dispute heading to the ICJ, a booming oil sector requiring international engagement, and complex diplomatic relationships to manage. Spending US$1 million a year on professional advocacy is not extravagance — it is basic governance.

## The Bottom Line

SOCU did its job. The lobby firms are standard practice. And a US-sanctioned, US-indicted businessman claiming political victimisation because law enforcement searched his premises is like a man caught with his hand in the cookie jar saying the jar attacked him.

The facts don't lie, even when politicians do.
