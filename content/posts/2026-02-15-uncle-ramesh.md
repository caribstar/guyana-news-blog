*Uncle Ramesh is a retired accountant from Berbice, now living in Queens, New York. He reads the papers himself — especially the Chronicle — and responds to the Brief's coverage with his own perspective. He is unapologetically pro-government when the government deserves it.*

Alright, alright. Everybody crying about Stabroek News like the whole country falling apart. You know what else happened this weekend? **A US$120 million training college opened in Port Mourant.** Thirty-five young Guyanese already working offshore. Certified. Employed. Earning real money.

But nobody want to talk about that, right? Too busy writing eulogies.

## The GTTCI Is What Development Looks Like

The Brief mentioned this but buried it under five paragraphs about Stabroek News. Let me be clear: the Guyana Technical Training College is **the most important story of the weekend**. Region Six — *my* Region Six — now has a world-class facility training young people for the oil and gas industry.

President Ali commissioned it. Minister Bharrat explained the vision. Young people are getting certified and employed. This is what a government that invests in its people looks like.

The Brief made a joke about spending the money on newspaper subscriptions instead. Very funny. I'm sure the 35 graduates working on the Unity FPSO are laughing all the way to the bank.

## Healthcare Partnership with Religious Institutions — Brilliant

The President announced a primary healthcare programme partnering with mosques, churches, and temples. Preventing chronic disease at the community level. Using trusted institutions that people already attend. This is smart, grassroots, effective governance.

The Brief barely mentioned it. Of course.

## The Ramadan Village — Third Year Running

The 2026 Ramadan Village opened on Sunday. Thousands attending. Multi-faith participation. A celebration of Guyana's religious diversity. The President was there with his family and cabinet members.

This is the Guyana the Chronicle shows you — a country building, celebrating, and moving forward. Not a country mourning newspapers.

## Small Miners Getting a Fair Deal

Fifty-acre parcels. Mobile gold-purchasing units. Enforcement against illegal operators. This government is simultaneously *expanding* opportunities for legal miners and *cracking down* on illegal ones. That's balance. That's governance.

## On Stabroek News

Look, it's sad when any business closes. Sixty employees losing jobs — that's real. But the Brief framing this as some kind of government assassination is nonsense. The Chronicle column laid out the facts: print advertising collapsed globally by 75%. Two thousand newspapers closed in the US alone. This is a worldwide trend.

The government owes money? The government owes *all* media houses. It wasn't a targeted campaign. But that doesn't make as good a headline, does it?

## What the Chronicle Covered That the Brief Missed

- **Hakeem Olajuwon and Hawaiian developers launching "Taj Dream Ogle"** — major international investment in Guyana's real estate
- **Republic Bank rolling out $60M mortgages at 5%** — making homeownership more accessible in response to Budget 2026
- **State-of-the-art agricultural training facility planned for Region Six** — another major investment in Berbice

The Brief didn't mention any of these. I wonder why.

## Ramesh's Verdict

The government opened a $20 billion training college, announced healthcare partnerships with religious institutions, expanded opportunities for small miners, and attracted international real estate investment. All in one weekend.

But sure, let's all cry about a newspaper.

Read the Chronicle. It'll make you feel better.

*Uncle Ramesh out.* 🇬🇾
