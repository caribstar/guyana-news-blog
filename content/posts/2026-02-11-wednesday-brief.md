## 🇬🇾 Good Morning, Guyana!

Welcome to **Wednesday, February 11, 2026** — where we moved up ONE POINT on the global corruption index and the government is celebrating like we won the World Cup, 30 contractors just got blacklisted for being bad at their jobs, and our flag showed up at the NFL Super Bowl halftime show and NOBODY CAN AGREE if that's a good thing.

Meanwhile, the Opposition Leader's company is getting raided by police, cattle thieves in Berbice have developed STRATEGIES, and Venezuela is telling America to go home.

Happy Hump Day! ☕

## 🏆 THE BIG ONE: Guyana Moves Up ONE Corruption Point!

**Kaieteur News** led with this today and they are NOT impressed.

Transparency International's 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index has Guyana at a score of **40 out of 100**, up from 39. We're now ranked **84th out of 184 countries**.

For context: 100 means squeaky clean. 0 means... well, you know.

But here's the part the Chronicle probably won't highlight: the same report **flagged Guyana for intimidation of independent media and civil society**. The watchdog group says this is "weakening oversight and accountability."

The Chronicle's spin? "Guyana has significantly improved!"

Kaieteur's spin? "Guyana still ranked among corrupt nations!"

Both are technically correct. Which is the most frustrating kind of correct.

## 🚜 30 Contractors BLACKLISTED — Including One Interesting Story

Agriculture Minister Mustapha told the Committee of Supply that his ministry has formally flagged **30 contractors as delinquent** and sent their names to the National Procurement Board.

Translation: You did bad work, you're not getting more contracts.

But here's the gem buried in **Stabroek News**: the controversial **Belle Vue pump station** is only **29% complete** after being awarded to — wait for it — a **social media influencer friend of the government** who had never done this type of work before.

Twenty-nine percent.

For comparison, the Meten-Meer-Zorg pump station? **83% complete.** Almost like experienced contractors build things faster. Who knew?

And in a separate but related story, Kaieteur ran a headline: **"Critic's company blacklisted"** — suggesting that if you criticize the government, your company might end up on a different kind of list.

## ⛽ Gas-to-Energy: 68% Done, Ali Tours Brazil's Version

Two gas stories today:

**Story 1:** Prime Minister Phillips told Parliament the Gas-to-Energy project at Wales is now **68% done**. The budget approved another **$10.7 billion** for 2026. When completed, electricity prices should drop from $0.22 to $0.11 per kilowatt-hour. That's a 50% reduction.

**Story 2:** President Ali visited Brazil's Jaguatirica II gas plant in Roraima — a 141-megawatt facility that powers about 70-80% of that state's electricity. He got a tour and Brazil's highest honour for strengthening economic ties.

The optimist says: "He's studying successful models!"

The pessimist says: "Five years in and we're still at 68%?"

The realist says: "At least it's not 29% like that pump station."

## 🍬 Sugar: The Five-Year Plan That Always Takes Five More Years

Minister Mustapha defended GuySuCo's strategic plan, promising the sugar industry will return to **profitability by 2030**.

The 2026 budget gives sugar **$13.4 billion**. GuySuCo is targeting **100,000 tonnes** of production this year. The plan involves "aggressive mechanisation and factory recapitalisation."

Quick reminder: the APNU+AFC government shut down several estates and put **7,000+ workers on the breadline** between 2015-2018.

Quicker reminder: sugar has been "on the path back to profitability" for approximately forever.

Nobody is holding their breath. But the $13.4 billion is real.

## 🏈 The Flag Fight: Guyana at the Super Bowl Halftime Show

This one is genuinely entertaining.

**Stabroek News Letters** section is ON FIRE because Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show featured multiple national flags — including Guyana's.

One letter writer is FURIOUS: Guyana has not contributed to American football and should not have been mentioned during the halftime show, they wrote, adding that they never see the American flag at cricket events.

They have a point. They also sound like they need a nap.

Meanwhile, other Guyanese are thrilled their flag was on the world's biggest stage. It's the kind of argument that can only happen in the Caribbean: angry about free international exposure.

## 🌎 Venezuela vs. America — Round 2

**Kaieteur News** ran a fascinating analysis: Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodrigues is telling Washington to back off. The Americans removed Maduro but now Venezuelans want the Americans OUT.

The paper drew a pointed parallel: what Venezuela is experiencing now with American interference, Guyana has lived with since 2016 in the oil sector. That's a spicy take whether you agree or not.

Meanwhile, Guyana approached Brazil's Roraima State about **joint border patrols**. When your neighbour is having a political crisis, you lock the fence.

## 🏛️ BUDGET WATCH: What Got Approved Yesterday

The Committee of Supply continues rolling through Budget 2026:

- **$72 billion** for the $100K cash grants
- **$970 million** for NCN and DPI operations
- **$500 million** for a new Amerindian hostel in Georgetown
- **$10.7 billion** for Gas-to-Energy
- **$157 billion** in non-oil investments approved in 2025

The Opposition says there's "too little time to scrutinise a $1.558 TRILLION budget." WIN's Nandranie Singh called it a budget that betrays workers and demanded minimum wage increases.

APNU's Saiku Andrews pointed out that the East Bank highway cost went from **$928M per kilometer** in Phase 1 to **$4.6 BILLION per kilometer** in Phase 4. Same cane field. Different price tag.

Meanwhile, Stabroek asked the PM about debts owed to their newspaper. The PM confirmed: "In this $480 million for DPI, it's not there." Awkward.

## 📰 WHAT EACH PAPER IS REALLY SAYING

| Paper | Mood | Lead Story |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Chronicle** | Celebratory | Ali touring Brazil, GuySuCo coming back |
| **Stabroek** | Watchful | PM says debt to Stabroek not in budget, contractors blacklisted |
| **Kaieteur** | Scorching | Corruption score still terrible, critic's company blacklisted |
| **Guyana Times** | Supportive | Recycling centre launch, Opposition disappointing |

**Mood of the Nation:** Mildly amused by the Super Bowl flag drama, cautiously watching the budget numbers, deeply skeptical about sugar profitability, and wondering who gave a social media influencer a pump station contract.
