*A Pro-Government Perspective from Queens, NY* 🗽🇬🇾

---

## Greetings from Queens, Beta!

Ayyo! Uncle Ramesh just finish me Friday coffee and I reading de papers online. And you know what? TODAY I actually agree with something in de Daily Brief!

GRA fired them officers who was helping Azruddin Mohamed transfer vehicles? **GOOD!**

See, this is what accountability look like! De government not playing favorites. When you break de law, you face consequences - whether you helping de opposition leader or not!

But of course, de Brief trying to make it seem like government at fault. NO! Government CAUGHT dem and FIRED dem! Dat is de system WORKING!

---

## 🏭 RUSAL COMING BACK - THIS IS HUGE NEWS!

De Brief mention RUSAL returning like it just a footnote. Beta, let me explain to you what this mean:

**JOBS FOR LINDEN!**

You know how long Region 10 been struggling since de bauxite industry decline? You know how many young people had to leave Upper Demerara to find work?

Now RUSAL coming back! Mining operations resuming! Jobs returning!

**But de Brief asking:** "What changed? Did they agree to pay workers living wage?"

You know what, maybe BOTH sides learned something in six years! Maybe de company ready to do better AND de workers ready to negotiate properly. Dat is called PROGRESS!

| RUSAL Impact | Benefits |
|--------------|----------|
| Jobs | Hundreds for Region 10 |
| Revenue | More taxes for development |
| Economy | Boost for Upper Berbice |
| Skills | Training for young Guyanese |

De PPP government NEGOTIATED this return. Dat is LEADERSHIP!

## 💰 CHRISTOPHER RAM AND HIS "FISCAL OZEMPIC"

Ah, Christopher Ram. Every time de government announce something good, he find a reason to complain.

Now he saying government need "appetite control" on spending. He want dem to stop building roads, stop building schools, stop giving people house lots?

**Let me ask Ram a question:** When de last time you PRAISED anything de government do?

De man comparing government spending to WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS? Really?

You know what, Uncle Ramesh got a response: **YOU CAN'T DEVELOP A COUNTRY BY STARVING IT!**

| What Ram Calls "Overspending" | What It Actually Is |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Housing program | 15,000 families getting homes |
| Cash grants | Money in people pockets |
| Infrastructure | Roads connecting communities |
| Schools | Children getting education |
| Hospitals | Healthcare for all |

Ram want "restraint"? The PNC showed restraint for 23 years and look where it left we!

## 🏠 15,000 HOUSE LOTS - THAT IS PROGRESS!

De Brief mention de housing numbers but then immediately start questioning drainage and roads.

**BETA!** You think de government building house lots in de bush without infrastructure? You think they ain't planning roads, drainage, water, electricity?

Minister Croal and de whole Housing Ministry been working on comprehensive development. You want everything perfect from day one? That's not how development work!

**What I know:** Families who couldn't afford homes now getting opportunities. Young couples starting their lives. People OWNING property instead of renting forever.

Dat is de PPP vision. Homeownership for ALL!

## 📰 What Uncle Ramesh Reading in De Chronicle Today

De Brief don't want to highlight de GOOD news, so let Uncle Ramesh do it:

✅ **China-Guyana health partnership expanding** - New therapies, obesity programs coming 2026
✅ **Roraima Airways cutting fares 7%** - Hinterland travel getting cheaper
✅ **Region Two Mashramani** - Young people celebrating Republic anniversary
✅ **GCCI praising Budget 2026** - Private sector happy with business measures

You see how much POSITIVE news happening? But de Brief want focus on GRA officers getting fired like that is BAD news!

## 🎯 About Dat Oil Price Drop

Yes, oil prices might dip. Yes, de Venezuela situation complicate things.

**But guess what?** De government PREPARING for this! They not waiting for crisis to respond!

- More FPSOs coming online means more production
- Natural Resource Fund building up reserves
- Diversification into agriculture, tourism, services
- Infrastructure investments creating long-term value

Christopher Ram want to compare dis to weight loss? Fine. De government on a HEALTHY DIET of balanced spending and smart investment. Not starvation!

## 🎤 Uncle Ramesh Final Word

Today is Friday. Is de end of another week of PROGRESS in Guyana.

GRA catching corrupt officers. ✅
RUSAL bringing back jobs. ✅
Housing program continuing. ✅
Budget 2026 investing in people. ✅
International partnerships growing. ✅

And what de opposition doing? Aubrey Norton refusing to make budget suggestions because he scared government will "steal" his ideas.

BETA! If your ideas so good that government would want to implement them, THAT'S A WIN FOR THE PEOPLE!

But no, he rather sulk than help Guyanese.

Meanwhile, de PPP working. Building. Delivering.

**Have a blessed weekend, everyone!** Go enjoy dat extra money in your pocket from de cash grant!

**One Guyana!** 🇬🇾
