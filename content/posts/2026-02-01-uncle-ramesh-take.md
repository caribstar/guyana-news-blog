## 💰 Budget 2026: $1.558 TRILLION of Vision

Listen, when this government present a $1.558 trillion budget, that is not just numbers. That is VISION. Minister Rodrigues correct — this budget is ambitious and bold. And it SHOULD be ambitious and bold because we have the resources now to match the ambition.

The Chronicle report that this is the first instalment in delivering the 2026-2030 manifesto vision. Every single allocation — from housing to health to education to infrastructure — is backed by revenue. This is not fantasy budgeting. This is a government that won an election and is delivering on promises.

The opposition going to get up Monday and complain. That is their job. But the PEOPLE know what this budget means for their lives.

## 🏦 The Development Bank Is a Game Changer — Full Stop

The Brief make joke about the Development Bank announcement. But let me tell you something as a retired accountant: US$100 million in interest-free loans, no collateral required, targeting youth, women, and persons with disabilities — that is REVOLUTIONARY for Guyana.

Do you know how many brilliant young Guyanese can't start a business because the commercial banks want collateral they don't have? Do you know how many women with good ideas get turned away? Minister Griffith is right — this removes barriers that existed for DECADES under every previous government.

The Brief say "announcement came before infrastructure." That is how government works! You announce the policy, you build the system, you deliver. What — they want the government to build everything in secret and then surprise people? This is transparency. This is accountability.

## 🇬🇧 UK Partnership Shows Guyana's Global Standing

President Ali visit to the UK — and the UK Deputy PM saying they're "proud" to partner with Guyana on climate and biodiversity — that is international recognition of Guyana's leadership.

The Brief didn't even give this proper coverage. Five years ago, nobody in London was talking about Guyana. Now the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is signing agreements with us. That is what happens when you have a President who can walk into ANY room in the world and command respect.

## 🛤️ $1 Billion in Mahdia Roads — Local Contractors Benefiting

The Chronicle report that over $1.066 billion was invested in completed road rehabilitation in Mahdia, Region Eight. And ALL the work was done by LOCAL contractors.

That is money going directly into hinterland communities. That is jobs for Guyanese people. Minister Ramraj personally inspected the work and held contractors accountable for quality. That is governance.

The Brief didn't mention this at all. Too busy making jokes about mobile pumps.

## 🌉 On the Demerara Bridge Incident

Yes, the bridge accident was tragic and the unlicensed driver is a serious issue. But Minister Edghill responded immediately. First responders were on scene. The driver was arrested. The truck owner was charged.

That is the system working. The Brief want to blame the government for every individual who breaks the law. Should the government personally check every driver's licence before they cross the bridge? The person committed a crime and is being prosecuted. What more do you want?

---

## 📺 What the Brief MISSED

As usual, the Brief skipped stories that show progress:

**Tourism getting major Budget 2026 support** — tourism providers praised the new measures. This sector is going to EXPLODE in the next five years.

**Minister Rodrigues** emphasized that Budget 2026 puts "Guyanese at the centre of prosperity." Not foreign companies. Not consultants. GUYANESE.

**$50 billion for Region Three farm-to-market roads** — the government mapping out strategic food production plans. This is food security. This is agriculture development. This is REAL work.

But the Brief too busy with scorecard jokes to cover substance.

## 🇻🇪 On Venezuela

Maduro captured. Guyana's borders secure. Security forces fully mobilised. President Ali handled this crisis with calm, decisive leadership from day one.

The opposition? Busy fighting over GECOM seats while the country faces real security challenges. Priorities.
