## 💅 THE "SOMEBODY WARN HIM" CHRONICLES

Word on de street is that a certain POLITICAL FIGURE (let we call him "Rudy from Richmond Hill") been getting phone calls from ALL OVER de diaspora telling him: "Bai, yuh SURE yuh want dis Opposition Leader ting?"

Apparently, "Rudy" been answering every call with: "Me lawyers say me fine."

But here de ting, darling — when yuh need LAWYERS to tell yuh yuh fine, yuh probably NOT fine!

One little birdie tell me dat "Rudy" wife (let we call she "Sandra") been asking some VERY pointed questions like: "So if we can't travel to America, where we going for Christmas? VENEZUELA?!"

*Chile, de irony!*

## 🎭 THE TIKTOK LAWYER

So a FORMER PARLIAMENTARIAN (let we call him "Charlie from Corentyne") decide he was gon challenge de ATTORNEY GENERAL on LEGAL TERMINOLOGY... on TIKTOK!

Darling, de confidence!

Sources say "Charlie" spent THREE HOURS making dat video, complete with dramatic pauses and hand gestures. He even had he wife hold de ring light!

But den de AG went on TV and read de ACTUAL LAW, word for word, like a teacher correcting a child who ain't do de homework.

Now "Charlie" phone going straight to voicemail and he TikTok comments section look like a crime scene!

*Lesson learned: Don't challenge lawyers about law on social media. Dat never end well!*

## 👀 THE BELGIAN CONNECTION

Me hear a certain MINISTER (let we call him "Danny from Diamond") had a meeting with some BELGIANS about ports.

Now, de official story is "technical cooperation."

But one of me sources — a maid who work for somebody who know somebody who was serving de tea at de meeting — say de Belgians couldn't believe how CHEAP de land prices are in Guyana!

One Belgian man allegedly whisper to he colleague: "In Antwerp, this would cost 100 times more!"

*Belgium discovering what we know all along — Guyana is de best kept secret in de Caribbean! Well, it WAS a secret...*

## 💊 DE 70KG STORY

So CANU catch 70 KILOS of cocaine in Parika, right?

De official story: "Information received."

De STREET story? Apparently, one of de men involve was bragging at a bar de night before about how he was about to "come into some money."

He even bought a round of drinks for EVERYBODY!

De next morning? CANU at he door.

*Loose lips sink ships, darling. And in dis case, loose lips get yuh 25 years!*

## 🏃 THE STADIUM SITUATION

Bayrock Stadium opening January 31 and EVERYBODY in Linden want invitation to de ceremony!

Me hear one REGIONAL OFFICIAL (let we call him "Ricky from Republic Avenue") been printing "VIP" passes from he HOME PRINTER and giving dem out to friends!

Problem is, he print like 200 passes... and de VIP section only hold 50 people!

*January 31 gon be INTERESTING when 200 people show up claiming VIP access!*
