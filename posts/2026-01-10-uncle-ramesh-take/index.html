They adding up murder rates!\nProblem is: They still getting the CONCLUSIONS wrong!\nLet Uncle Ramesh show this youngin’ how numbers ACTUALLY work.\nâš¡ 69,000 VOLTS: THE BRIEF FINALLY GOT ONE RIGHT The Brief says: “Contractor almost killed himself”\nUncle Ramesh says: YES! EXACTLY! This is SERIOUS!\nFor ONCE, The Brief not making jokes! They treating this like the CRISIS it is!\nUncle Ramesh Approves: âœ“\nNo mocking, no clever headlines, just straight reporting that contractor almost got VAPORIZED.\nSee? When The Brief TRIES, they can do REAL journalism!\nMore of THIS, less of “Storage Unit Edition” nonsense!\nDS “PLAYING VICTIM”: BRIEF HALF RIGHT The Brief says: “They’re playing the victim card”\nUncle Ramesh says: Yes, BUTâ€”\nHere’s what The Brief MISSING:\nThe Mohameds ARE guilty (probably). Uncle Ramesh ain’t defending them.\nBUT: The system SHOULDN’T take this long! That’s ALSO true!\nBoth Can Be True:\nMohameds using every legal trick = TRUE System allowing infinite appeals = ALSO TRUE Courts moving too slow = ALSO TRUE The Brief only focus on #1. Where the outrage about #2 and #3?\nFix the SYSTEM! Then people can’t game it!\nSTATS: THE BRIEF DISCOVERS PERCENTAGES! The Brief says: “Murders up, but crime is down!”\nUncle Ramesh says: Let me explain statistics to this youngin':\nHow Statistics ACTUALLY Work: Overall Crime: Robberies, burglaries, larceny, theft, murder, assault, etc.\nIf:\nRobberies DOWN 30% (that’s A LOT of cases!) Burglaries DOWN 25% Larceny DOWN 20% Murders UP 11% (that’s 13 more cases) Then: OVERALL crime CAN be down even if murders up!\nThe Brief Acting Like: Government lying! It’s a trick! Look at murders!\nReality: BOTH true! Overall serious crimes down 25.5%! Murders up 11%! These BOTH facts!\nWhat Government SHOULD Say: “Overall crime down significantly, but we’re concerned about murder increase and working on it.”\nWhat Government SAID: “Crime is down!” (ignoring murder spike)\nWhat The Brief Said: “They’re lying!” (ignoring overall reduction)\nBoth Wrong! Uncle Ramesh the ONLY one with sense!\nHOUSES: THE BRIEF CAN’T DO MATH The Brief says: “36.5 houses per day required!”\nUncle Ramesh says: That’s NOT how construction works, child!\nLet Uncle Ramesh School You: The Brief’s Math: 40,000 houses Ã· 3 years Ã· 365 days = 36.5 per day\nSounds Impossible!\nBut Wait:\nIf you have 100 CONTRACTORS working on 10 houses EACH simultaneously, that’s 1,000 houses being built AT THE SAME TIME!\nConstruction Math:\n40 houses Ã— 25 contractors = 1,000 houses in construction Each take 3 months to complete = 4,000 houses per YEAR possible = 12,000 in 3 years Still SHORT of 40,000, but not the IMPOSSIBLE number The Brief claiming!\nThe REAL Question: Not “can they build 37/day” but “do they have enough contractors, materials, and workers?”\nAsk the RIGHT Questions, Brief!\nICITY PROMISE: BRIEF ACTUALLY RIGHT The Brief says: “Still waiting for ’no blackouts’”\nUncle Ramesh says: CORRECT!\nThey promised “no more blackouts by end of 2024.” It’s 2026. Still getting blackouts.\nUncle Ramesh Agrees: âœ“\nThis is BROKEN promise. Government need to answer for this.\nSee? When The Brief is RIGHT, Uncle Ramesh SAYS SO!\nTION MISSING: THE BRIEF WRONG AGAIN The Brief says: “Where is the opposition?”\nUncle Ramesh says: They RIGHT THERE! You ain’t looking!\nOpposition Been Saying:\nThird-country deportations wrong! Government breaking promises! Constitutional violations! The Brief: “WhErE aRe ThEy?”\nThey THERE! You just not LISTENING because you busy writing clever headlines!\nThe REAL Issue: Parliament can’t convene until Mohamed case resolves. That’s DIFFERENT from “opposition is missing!”\nLearn the DIFFERENCE!\nâœˆï¸ AISHALTON AIRSTRIP: BRIEF FINALLY SAYS SOMETHING NICE The Brief says: “Actually good news! Project working!”\nUncle Ramesh says: FINALLY! Some POSITIVITY!\nSee what happens when The Brief not being cynical? They can actually ACKNOWLEDGE good work!\nMore of this! Balance! Perspective! Not everything failure!\nM: THE BRIEF STILL MISSING THE POINT On Vloggers:\nThe Brief STILL defending people who film negative content!\nUncle Ramesh Says: You can’t film ONLY garbage dumps then claim you’re showing “reality”!\nREAL Balance: Film some good, some bad, give CONTEXT!\nWhat These Vloggers Did: Film ONLY bad, ignore good, get views from people who want to see “Third World poverty”\nThat’s not journalism! That’s POVERTY PORN for YouTube money!\nHE BRIEF REALLY MISSED 1. The Mohamed System Failure: Not just “they’re playing victim” - the SYSTEM letting them!\n2. Crime Statistics Nuance: Both can be true! Overall down, murders up! BOTH problems to address!\n3. Housing Math: Construction don’t work like Brief think it do!\n4. Opposition Visibility: They THERE! Brief just not paying attention!\nRAMESH’S COUNTER-BRIEF What We ACTUALLY Learned Saturday:\nâœ… Contractor safety serious issue (Brief got this!) âš ï¸ Mohameds gaming system (but system broken too!) âš ï¸ Crime stats complex (both up AND down!) âŒ Housing math WRONG (Brief can’t calculate construction!) âœ… Electricity promises broken (Brief correct!) âŒ Opposition not missing (Brief not looking!) âœ… Aishalton good news (Brief finally positive!) âŒ Vlogger take still wrong! Score: Brief got 3 out of 8 right. That’s 37.5%!\nEven THAT math better than their housing calculation!\nWORD FROM QUEENS This youngin’ learning! Slowly! But learning!\nThey Got Better At:\nTaking contractor safety seriously âœ“ Acknowledging Aishalton success âœ“ Calling out broken electricity promises âœ“ They Still Bad At:\nUnderstanding statistics âœ— Calculating construction âœ— Finding the opposition âœ— Balanced vlogger takes âœ— Progress! Small, but progress!\nMessages for The Brief:\nOn Contractor Safety: GOOD JOB! Keep this serious tone!\nOn Mohameds: Ask about the SYSTEM, not just mock them!\nOn Crime Stats: Learn how percentages WORK! Both can be true!\nOn Housing Math: Construction don’t work like that! Get expert opinion!\nOn Electricity: You RIGHT! Keep pressure on government!\nOn Opposition: Open your EYES! They there!\nOn Aishalton: More positive stories! Balance!\nOn Vloggers: Context MATTERS! Stop defending poverty porn!\nMy wife asking why I still reading this Brief if it frustrate me so much. Because SOMEBODY got to keep them honest!\nStay BALANCED. Stay INFORMED. And for God’s sake, learn how CONSTRUCTION WORKS before you calculate!\nâ€” Uncle Ramesh\nCalling from Queens, NY\nWhere we know 37 houses/day ain’t how building works\nâ±ï¸ Uncle Ramesh Talk Time: 6 minutes\nâ˜• Coffee consumed: 2 cups\ns I corrected The Brief’s math:** 3\nf’s Accuracy Score:** 37.5% (failing grade!)\nStill reading:** Yes (somebody gotta!)\ncle Ramesh: Teaching The Brief math since 2026!\nShare this if you know construction math different from division!\n",

<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh Approves:</strong> âœ“</p>
<p>No mocking, no clever headlines, just straight reporting that contractor almost got VAPORIZED.</p>
<p><strong>See?</strong> When The Brief TRIES, they can do REAL journalism!</p>
<p>More of THIS, less of &ldquo;Storage Unit Edition&rdquo; nonsense!</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re playing the victim card&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> Yes, BUTâ€”</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what The Brief MISSING:</p>
<p><strong>The Mohameds ARE guilty</strong> (probably). Uncle Ramesh ain&rsquo;t defending them.</p>
<p><strong>BUT:</strong> The system SHOULDN&rsquo;T take this long! That&rsquo;s ALSO true!</p>
<p><strong>Both Can Be True:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mohameds using every legal trick = TRUE</li>
<li>System allowing infinite appeals = ALSO TRUE</li>
<li>Courts moving too slow = ALSO TRUE</li>
</ol>
<p>The Brief only focus on #1. Where the outrage about #2 and #3?</p>
<p><strong>Fix the SYSTEM!</strong> Then people can&rsquo;t game it!</p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Murders up, but crime is down!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> Let me explain statistics to this youngin':</p>
<h3 id="how-statistics-actually-work"><strong>How Statistics ACTUALLY Work:</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-statistics-actually-work">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overall Crime:</strong> Robberies, burglaries, larceny, theft, murder, assault, etc.</p>
<p><strong>If:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Robberies DOWN 30% (that&rsquo;s A LOT of cases!)</li>
<li>Burglaries DOWN 25%</li>
<li>Larceny DOWN 20%</li>
<li>Murders UP 11% (that&rsquo;s 13 more cases)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then:</strong> OVERALL crime CAN be down even if murders up!</p>
<p><strong>The Brief Acting Like:</strong>
Government lying! It&rsquo;s a trick! Look at murders!</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong>
BOTH true! Overall serious crimes down 25.5%! Murders up 11%! These BOTH facts!</p>
<p><strong>What Government SHOULD Say:</strong>
&ldquo;Overall crime down significantly, but we&rsquo;re concerned about murder increase and working on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What Government SAID:</strong>
&ldquo;Crime is down!&rdquo; (ignoring murder spike)</p>
<p><strong>What The Brief Said:</strong>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re lying!&rdquo; (ignoring overall reduction)</p>
<p><strong>Both Wrong!</strong> Uncle Ramesh the ONLY one with sense!</p>

<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> That&rsquo;s NOT how construction works, child!</p>
<h3 id="let-uncle-ramesh-school-you"><strong>Let Uncle Ramesh School You:</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#let-uncle-ramesh-school-you">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Brief&rsquo;s Math:</strong>
40,000 houses Ã· 3 years Ã· 365 days = 36.5 per day</p>
<p><strong>Sounds Impossible!</strong></p>
<p><strong>But Wait:</strong></p>
<p>If you have 100 CONTRACTORS working on 10 houses EACH simultaneously, that&rsquo;s 1,000 houses being built AT THE SAME TIME!</p>
<p><strong>Construction Math:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>40 houses Ã— 25 contractors = 1,000 houses in construction</li>
<li>Each take 3 months to complete</li>
<li>= 4,000 houses per YEAR possible</li>
<li>= 12,000 in 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Still SHORT of 40,000, but not the IMPOSSIBLE number The Brief claiming!</p>
<p><strong>The REAL Question:</strong>
Not &ldquo;can they build 37/day&rdquo; but &ldquo;do they have enough contractors, materials, and workers?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ask the RIGHT Questions, Brief!</strong></p>

<p>The Brief says: <em>&ldquo;Still waiting for &rsquo;no blackouts&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> CORRECT!</p>
<p>They promised &ldquo;no more blackouts by end of 2024.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s 2026. Still getting blackouts.</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh Agrees:</strong> âœ“</p>
<p>This is BROKEN promise. Government need to answer for this.</p>

<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh says:</strong> They RIGHT THERE! You ain&rsquo;t looking!</p>
<p><strong>Opposition Been Saying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Third-country deportations wrong!</li>
<li>Government breaking promises!</li>
<li>Constitutional violations!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Brief:</strong> &ldquo;WhErE aRe ThEy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They THERE! You just not LISTENING because you busy writing clever headlines!</p>

<p><strong>Uncle Ramesh Says:</strong> You can&rsquo;t film ONLY garbage dumps then claim you&rsquo;re showing &ldquo;reality&rdquo;!</p>
<p><strong>REAL Balance:</strong>
Film some good, some bad, give CONTEXT!</p>
<p><strong>What These Vloggers Did:</strong>
Film ONLY bad, ignore good, get views from people who want to see &ldquo;Third World poverty&rdquo;</p>

<li>âš ï¸ Mohameds gaming system (but system broken too!)</li>
<li>âš ï¸ Crime stats complex (both up AND down!)</li>
