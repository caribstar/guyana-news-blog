## 🛢️ OIL SECTOR SNAPSHOT

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Daily production (Dec 2025) | 892,000 barrels/day |
| Active FPSOs | 4 (Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, Prosperity, ONE GUYANA) |
| Shell's position | CEO admits leaving was "missed opportunity" |
| Local Content Law | Government eyes expansion to mining sector |
| Noble Corporation | Vendor Day Feb 19 — expanding local partnerships |

**Key development:** Guyana's oil production continues to attract regional attention. Argentina, Guyana, and Brazil are projected to lead Latin American oil growth in 2026, outpacing Venezuela.

## 📉 MEDIA MARKET DISRUPTION

**Stabroek News closure** is an economic story, not just a media story:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Print ad revenue decline | 75% globally since 2004 |
| Employment loss | GPI staff facing liquidation |
| Information market | Reduced independent coverage |
| Digital transition | No announced digital replacement |
| Remaining print papers | Chronicle, Kaieteur, Times |

**Patriot's take:** Stabroek's closure leaves a gap in Guyana's media ecosystem. For investors and businesses, this means fewer channels for public communication and a concentration of media influence. The smart play? Watch for digital media investment opportunities.

## 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WATCH

| Schoonord to Crane asphalt | Budgeted for 2026 |

## 🏦 FINANCIAL SECTOR NOTES

- Bank account closures linked to WIN party members sparking debate about financial sector independence
- Guyana Development Bank establishment underway — US$100M for interest-free loans without collateral
- Financial sector transformation accelerating but calls for consistency and transparency

---

## 📊 PATRIOT'S BOTTOM LINE

**Bulls case:** $150B housing spend, free university driving human capital, oil production stable, infrastructure pipeline massive, Gas-to-Energy on track for Q4.

**Bears case:** Georgetown flooding exposes infrastructure gaps, police recruitment crisis (oil boom poaching officers), media ecosystem shrinking, data privacy concerns emerging.

**Verdict:** Guyana's economy is a construction site — impressive progress everywhere, but watch where you step. The fundamentals are strong. The execution needs to catch up with the ambition.
