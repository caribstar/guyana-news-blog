Another stern meeting. Revolutionary.\nNext time maybe a VERY stern meeting. Or an EXTREMELY stern meeting. The possibilities are endless!\nAt this rate, GuySuCo will hit targets when The Mohameds voluntarily board a plane—which is to say, never.\n⏳ THE MOHAMEDS: PROFESSIONAL STAYERS Their lawyer said they’re “NOT going anywhere.” Turns out, 100% accurate. Give that man a Nobel Prize in Honesty.\nUpdate: Extradition hearing adjourned to February 5th.\n📅 The Mohamed Calendar™:\nJanuary: File 3 appeals, adjourn hearing\nFebruary: File 4 more appeals, adjourn again\nMarch-December: See January-February, repeat with passion\nStatus: Still here, still filing, still making lawyers wealthy\nDeparture date: When GuySuCo meets targets (never)\nUS prosecutors asked to “bring forward” the hearing. Adorable. They must be new.\nIn Guyana’s legal system, “expedited” means “eventually,” “urgent” means “this decade,” and “NOT going anywhere” means exactly that.\nWhat happens first:\nVenus orbits the sun (224 days) A sloth finishes a marathon The Mohameds board a plane Spoiler: Venus.\n📉 CRIME STATS: CREATIVE MATHEMATICS The Police Force dropped their 2025 report: Serious crimes down 25.5%! 🎉\nThe fine print: Side effects include increased murders. Do not operate statistics while reading reality.\n📊 The ACTUAL Numbers:\nMurders: UP 11% Road deaths: UP 6% (137 people) “Serious crimes”: Down 25.5%! 🎉 Formula: Crime is down if you don’t count the crimes!\nIt’s like saying your diet’s amazing because you lost 5 pounds—just don’t mention the 15 you gained first.\nThings apparently NOT “serious crimes”:\nMurder (up 11%) Vehicular manslaughter (up 6%) Filing 47 appeals to avoid extradition Things that ARE “serious crimes”:\nPosting videos about gun licenses (see Stanley Basdeo below) The GPF expects celebration while murders are rising. It’s like celebrating the Titanic’s dry ballroom while the ship sank.\n🚤 RIP GOLDEN GLOVES: 70 YEARS WASN’T ENOUGH After SEVENTY YEARS of service, Golden Gloves speedboat was shut down by the GRA for “irregularities.”\nWhat existed in 1955:\nGolden Gloves ✅ The Soviet Union ✅ Polio vaccine ✅ What doesn’t exist anymore:\nAll of the above ❌ 📊 Survival Guide:\nWhat survives:\n✅ Mohamed legal defense (IMMORTAL) ✅ GuySuCo missing targets (ETERNAL) What doesn’t:\n❌ 70-year businesses (paperwork issues) ❌ Heroes Highway (25 months max) ❌ Opposition leadership (missing) Golden Gloves survived:\nIndependence, multiple governments, economic crises, the Cold War, Y2K, the ENTIRE Mohamed saga What killed it? Paperwork irregularities.\nAfter 70 years, NOW is regulation time.\nMeanwhile, The Mohameds have been “regularising” for years with 47 appeals. Nobody’s stopping THEM.\n💰 STANLEY BASDEO: COMPLAINED TOO LOUDLY US businessman Stanley Basdeo posted a video about:\nDifficulty getting gun licenses Bribery in Guyana Government’s response: CYBERCRIME CHARGES.\n📊 Legal Response Times:\nCharging video complaint: ⚡ 24 hours\nExtraditing actual criminals: 🐌 847+ days\nFixing bribery he mentioned: 🤔 File not found\nThe crime: Making a video about stuff everyone knows.\nThe punishment: $200,000 bail + surrendered passport.\nFor comparison:\nThe Mohameds: 47 appeals, still have passports Stanley: 1 video, passport confiscated The irony: He complained about bribery and now he’s in the legal system where… well, you get it.\nThings you CAN do:\nFile infinite appeals ✅ Miss targets annually ✅ Things you CANNOT do:\nPost videos about bribery ❌ Lesson: You can file 47 appeals (fine!), but you cannot post one (1) video about systemic issues (CYBERCRIME!).\n📅 THE WEEK AHEAD Monday: Last week’s chaos was an aberration. (It wasn’t.)\nTuesday: “On track” update #848. Drinking game optional.\nWednesday: Mohamed appeal #48. Lawyer buys third vacation home.\nThursday: GuySuCo misses micro-target. Blames solar flares.\nFriday: New timeline announced. Immediately obsolete.\nProbability GuySuCo meets target: 0.1%\nProbability Mohameds board plane: Cannot calculate impossibility\n📝 THE BOTTOM LINE Another Monday of delays (sorry, “adjustments”), projects “firmly on track” (hopelessly behind), and crime stats that defy mathematics.\nThe pattern:\nWork 70 years? Paperwork violation.\nFile appeals for 2+ years? Carry on!\nMeet targets? What’s a target? —GuySuCo\nPost videos? Cybercrime within 24 hours.\nBut hey, at least Costco toilet paper is coming (Feb 5). Given the amount of BS we wade through, we’ll need it.\nStay chaotic, Guyana. 🇬🇾\nP.S. - If complaints are cybercrime, this newsletter is toast. See you in court!

<li>Murders: UP 11%</li>
<li>Road deaths: UP 6% (137 people)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Serious crimes&rdquo;: Down 25.5%! 🎉</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> Crime is down if you don&rsquo;t count the crimes!</p>
</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying your diet&rsquo;s amazing because you lost 5 pounds—just don&rsquo;t mention the 15 you gained first.</p>
<p><strong>Things apparently NOT &ldquo;serious crimes&rdquo;:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Murder (up 11%)</li>
<li>Vehicular manslaughter (up 6%)</li>
<li>Filing 47 appeals to avoid extradition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things that ARE &ldquo;serious crimes&rdquo;:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Posting videos about gun licenses (see Stanley Basdeo below)</li>
</ul>
<p>The GPF expects celebration while murders are rising. It&rsquo;s like celebrating the Titanic&rsquo;s dry ballroom while the ship sank.</p>

<p>After <strong>SEVENTY YEARS</strong> of service, Golden Gloves speedboat was shut down by the GRA for &ldquo;irregularities.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What existed in 1955:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Golden Gloves ✅</li>
<li>The Soviet Union ✅</li>
<li>Polio vaccine ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All of the above ❌</li>
</ul>
<div style="background-color: #E0F2F1; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #009688; margin: 20px 0;">
<p><strong>📊 Survival Guide:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What survives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Mohamed legal defense (IMMORTAL)</li>
<li>✅ GuySuCo missing targets (ETERNAL)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>❌ 70-year businesses (paperwork issues)</li>
<li>❌ Heroes Highway (25 months max)</li>
<li>❌ Opposition leadership (missing)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Golden Gloves survived:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Independence, multiple governments, economic crises, the Cold War, Y2K, the ENTIRE Mohamed saga</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What killed it?</strong>
<em>Paperwork irregularities.</em></p>
<p>After 70 years, NOW is regulation time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Mohameds have been &ldquo;regularising&rdquo; for years with 47 appeals. Nobody&rsquo;s stopping THEM.</p>

<h2 id="x1f4b0-stanley-basdeo-complained-too-loudly">💰 STANLEY BASDEO: COMPLAINED TOO LOUDLY<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#x1f4b0-stanley-basdeo-complained-too-loudly">#</a></h2>
<p>US businessman Stanley Basdeo posted a video about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Difficulty getting gun licenses</li>
<li>Bribery in Guyana</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Government&rsquo;s response:</strong> CYBERCRIME CHARGES.</p>
<div style="background-color: #ECEFF1; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #607D8B; margin: 20px 0;">
<p><strong>📊 Legal Response Times:</strong></p>
<p>Charging video complaint: ⚡ 24 hours</p>
<p>Extraditing actual criminals: 🐌 847+ days</p>
<p>Fixing bribery he mentioned: 🤔 <em>File not found</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>The crime:</strong> Making a video about stuff everyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>The punishment:</strong> $200,000 bail + surrendered passport.</p>
<p><strong>For comparison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mohameds: 47 appeals, still have passports</li>
<li>Stanley: 1 video, passport confiscated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The irony:</strong> He complained about bribery and now he&rsquo;s in the legal system where&hellip; well, you get it.</p>
<p><strong>Things you CAN do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>File infinite appeals ✅</li>
<li>Miss targets annually ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things you CANNOT do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Post videos about bribery ❌</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> You can file 47 appeals (fine!), but you cannot post one (1) video about systemic issues (CYBERCRIME!).</p>

<h2 id="x1f4c5-the-week-ahead">📅 THE WEEK AHEAD<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#x1f4c5-the-week-ahead">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Last week&rsquo;s chaos was an aberration. (It wasn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> &ldquo;On track&rdquo; update #848. Drinking game optional.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Mohamed appeal #48. Lawyer buys third vacation home.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> GuySuCo misses micro-target. Blames solar flares.</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> New timeline announced. Immediately obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>Probability GuySuCo meets target:</strong> 0.1%</p>
<p><strong>Probability Mohameds board plane:</strong> <em>Cannot calculate impossibility</em></p>

<h2 id="x1f4dd-the-bottom-line">📝 THE BOTTOM LINE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#x1f4dd-the-bottom-line">#</a></h2>
<p>Another Monday of delays (sorry, &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo;), projects &ldquo;firmly on track&rdquo; (hopelessly behind), and crime stats that defy mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong></p>
<p>Work 70 years? Paperwork violation.</p>
<p>File appeals for 2+ years? Carry on!</p>
<p>Meet targets? What&rsquo;s a target? —GuySuCo</p>
<p>Post videos? Cybercrime within 24 hours.</p>
<p>But hey, at least Costco toilet paper is coming (Feb 5). Given the amount of BS we wade through, we&rsquo;ll need it.</p>
<p><strong>Stay chaotic, Guyana.</strong> 🇬🇾</p>
<p><em>P.S. - If complaints are cybercrime, this newsletter is toast. See you in court! (In 847 days, after 47 adjournments.)</em></p>
