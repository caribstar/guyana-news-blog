Live. In real time. While the whole Caribbean group chat was going absolutely wild.\nThe Awkward Part: Now Guyana has to pretend they\u0026rsquo;re not THRILLED about this. Because diplomacy. And international relations. And the fact that they share a border with a country that just got regime-changed via air strike.\n💰 THE MOHAMEDS: AMERICA\u0026rsquo;S MOST WANTED This father-son duo is having the kind of week that makes you reconsider all your life choices.\nThe Situation: The Mohameds are fighting extradition to Florida harder than your auntie fights for the last piece of black cake at Christmas.

The highway lasted about as long as a New Year\u0026rsquo;s resolution.\nTranslation: They built a highway with concrete. Premium concrete. It lasted barely over a year. Now they want to cover it with asphalt.\nThis is like:\nBuying a Tesla and gluing a bicycle on top Ordering premium steak and covering it with ketchup Building a mansion and putting up wallpaper to hide the cracks Stabroek News (Being Polite): \u0026ldquo;Questions have been raised about whether sound decisions are being made\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nUs (Not Being Polite): Y\u0026rsquo;ALL BUILT A HIGHWAY WRONG.\nThe Excuse: \u0026ldquo;The concrete surface requires an asphalt overlay for optimal performance.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Translation: \u0026ldquo;We messed up but we\u0026rsquo;re using technical words to make it sound intentional.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat Actually Happened: Someone made a decision.

The achievement isn\u0026rsquo;t the teaching. The achievement is that THE INTERNET DIDN\u0026rsquo;T CRASH.\nParticipating Schools: Dora Secondary, St. Cuthbert\u0026rsquo;s Secondary, Kwakwani Secondary, Linden Foundation Secondary, Anna Regina Secondary.\nThe Real Achievement: \u0026ldquo;Guyana Internet Works For Thing: Nation Shocked\u0026rdquo;\nParent\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;So my data plan is now a school supply?\u0026rdquo;\nTeacher\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;I spent 45 minutes troubleshooting connectivity and 10 minutes teaching.\u0026rdquo;\nGovernment\u0026rsquo;s Perspective: \u0026ldquo;DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION!
